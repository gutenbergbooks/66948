<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>About the middle of the last century there
was printed in England a children&#8217;s story with
the attractive title, &#8220;The Good Natured Bear.&#8221;
This story, written by Robert H. Horne, was
reviewed by William Makepeace Thackeray,
who at that time signed his criticisms M. A.
Titmarsh. Mr. Thackeray wrote an article
entitled &#8220;On Some Illustrated Children&#8217;s
Books&#8221; for <i>Fraser&#8217;s Magazine</i> in which he
made the following comment: &#8220;Let a word
be said in conclusion about the admirable
story of &#8216;The Good Natured Bear,&#8217; one of
the wittiest, pleasantest, and kindest of books
that I have read for many a long day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few years ago the editors of this collection
of stories found out-of-print copies of
&#8220;The Good Natured Bear,&#8221; &#8220;The Man of
Snow,&#8221; and &#8220;Finikin and His Golden Pippins&#8221;&mdash;all
old-fashioned tales for children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">[ii]</span>
Believing that young readers of to-day will
enjoy the good cheer and merry humour of
these stories, the editors have included them
in this volume with other happy tales which
are perhaps much better known.</p>

<p>The excellent humourous stories in the folklore
of all nations point out to us that good
cheer and merriment were favourite themes
of the olden-time story-teller. Some of his
rarest treasures were nonsense rhymes, fables,
and allegories which enlisted the sympathy of
his audience by inducing them to laugh with
him. With a merry twinkle in his eye we can
hear him addressing the tiniest listeners:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,</div>
<div class="verse">The cow jumped over the moon;</div>
<div class="verse">The little dog laughed to see such sport</div>
<div class="verse">And the dish ran away with the spoon.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Wide-eyed children pressing close to the enchanter
were not the only persons in that appreciative
audience who smiled at the first
picture suggested by the rhyme, laughed with
the little dog, and enjoyed with wholesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">[iii]</span>
abandon the merriment called forth by the incongruous
surprise of the last line. The story-teller
knew the refreshing value of hearty
laughter at pure nonsense.</p>

<p>The stories in this collection were written
by authors who had the precious gift of knowing
how to entertain young readers with narratives
of good cheer and happy frolic. Such
stories are valuable because they keep alive
and develop a wholesome sense of humour. It
is perfectly natural for a normal child to laugh
heartily at the grotesque antics of a circus
clown. But this elemental response to merry
fun should be trained and quickened into a
rich and varied sense of humour which can
laugh with Gareth when Lancelot unhorses
him; revel with Puck in Fairyland; and enjoy
a merry Christmas with the Cratchits.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GOOD-NATURED BEAR</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Richard H. Horne</span></p>
</div>

<h3><i>The First Evening</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Christmas evening a number of merry
children were invited to a party at Dr. Littlepump&#8217;s
country residence. The neat white
house with blue shutters stood on the best
street of the village. Nancy and her younger
brother, little Valentine, were the children of
Dr. Littlepump, and they had invited several
other children to come and spend Christmas
evening with them. Very happy they all
were. They danced to the music of a flute
and fiddle; they ran about and sang and
squeaked and hopped upon one leg and crept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
upon all fours and jumped over small cushions
and stools. Then they sat down in a
circle round the stove and laughed at the fire.</p>

<p>Besides Dr. and Mrs. Littlepump and the
children there were several others in the room
who joined in the merriment. First there was
Margaret who was seated in the middle of the
group of children. She was the pretty governess
of Nancy and little Valentine and one
of the nicest girls in the village. Then there
were Lydia, the housemaid, Dorothea, the
cook, Wallis, the gardener, and Uncle Abraham,
the younger brother of Dr. Littlepump.</p>

<p>Uncle Abraham was always doing kind
things in his quiet way, and everybody was
very fond of him. He sat in one corner of
the room, with his elbow resting upon a little
round table, smoking a large Dutch pipe, and
very busy with his own thoughts. Now and
then his eyes gave a twinkle, as if he was
pleased with something in his mind.</p>

<p>The children now all asked Margaret to
sing a pretty song, which she did at once with
her sweet voice; but the words were very odd.
This was the song:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;There came a rough-faced Stranger</div>
<div class="indent">From the leafless winter woods,</div>
<div class="verse">And he told of many a danger</div>
<div class="indent">From the snow-storms and black floods.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;On his back he bore the glory</div>
<div class="indent">Of his brothers, who were left</div>
<div class="verse">In a secret rocky cleft&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">Now guess his name, and story!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;But who was the rough-faced Stranger?&#8221;
asked Nancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was the glory he carried pick-a-back?&#8221;
cried little Valentine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were his brothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was the rocky cleft?&#8221; cried three
or four of the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;you must guess!&#8221;</p>

<p>So all the children began guessing at this
song-riddle; but they could make nothing
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do tell us the answer to the riddle
Margaret,&#8221; they coaxed.</p>

<p>At last Margaret said, &#8220;Well, I promise to
tell you all about the rough-faced Stranger in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
half an hour, if nothing happens to make you
forget to ask me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! we shall not forget to ask,&#8221; said
Nancy.</p>

<p>There was now a silence for a few minutes
as if the children were all thinking. Uncle
Abraham, who sometimes went to bed very
early, slowly rose from his chair, lighted his
candle, carefully snuffed it (and, as he did so,
his eyes gave a twinkle), and walking round
the outside of all the circle, wished them
good-night, and away he went to bed.</p>

<p>About eight o&#8217;clock in the evening, when
the snow lay deep upon the ground, a very
stout gentleman in a very rough coat and
fur boots got down from the outside of a carriage
which had stopped in front of Dr. Littlepump&#8217;s
door. In a trice all the children
crowded around the windows to look at the
carriage and the gentleman who had got down.</p>

<p>Besides his very rough coat and fur boots,
the stout gentleman wore a short cloak, a hunting
cap, and a pair of large fur gloves. The
cap was pulled down almost over his eyes, so
that his face could not be seen, and round his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
throat he had an immense orange-coloured
comforter.</p>

<p>The carriage now drove on, and left the
stout gentleman standing in the middle of the
street. He first shook the snow from his cloak.
After this he began to stamp with his feet to
warm them. This movement looked like a
clumsy dance in a little circle and all the children
laughed. The next thing he did was to
give himself a good rubbing on the breast and
he hit it so awkwardly that it looked like a
great clumsy paw on some creature giving
itself a scratch. At this the children laughed
louder than before. They were almost afraid
he would hear it through the windows. The
stout gentleman next drew forth an immense
pocket handkerchief and with this he began
to dust his face, to knock off the frost, and
also to warm his nose, which seemed to be very
large and long and to require great attention.
When the children saw the gentleman do this
they could keep quiet no longer; all burst out
into a loud shout of laughter.</p>

<p>The stout gentleman instantly stopped, and
began to look around him in all directions, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
see where the laughing came from. The children
suddenly became quiet. The stout gentleman
turned round and round, looking up
and down at the windows of every house near
him. At last his eyes rested on the three parlour
windows of Dr. Littlepump&#8217;s house,
which were crowded with faces. No sooner
had he done this than he walked towards the
house with a long stride and an angry air.</p>

<p>In an instant all the children ran away from
the windows crying out, &#8220;Here he comes!
Here he comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently a scraping was heard upon the
steps of the door, then a loud knock! The
children all ran to their seats and sat quite
silent, looking at one another. There was a
loud ringing of the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Mrs. Littlepump, &#8220;that
the stout gentleman is so much offended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know very well what to say to him,&#8221;
said Dr. Littlepump.</p>

<p>Again came the ringing of the bell!</p>

<p>Not one of them liked to go to open the
door.</p>

<p>Margaret rose to go and little Val cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
out, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you go, Margaret, dearest; let
Wallis go.&#8221; But when Margaret promised to
run away as soon as she had opened the door,
she was allowed to go. Both Nancy and Valentine
called after her, &#8220;Be sure to run back
to us as fast as ever you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children sat listening with all their
ears. Presently they did hear something. It
was the snap of the lock, the creaking of the
door, and a scrambling noise. Margaret came
running back into the room quite out of
breath, crying out, &#8220;Oh, such a nose! Such a
dirty face! Don&#8217;t ask me anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no time for any questions. A
slow, heavy footstep was heard in the hall,
then in the passage, then the parlour door
opened wide and in walked the stout gentleman
with the rough coat! He had, indeed, an
immense nose,&mdash;both long and broad and as
dark as the shadow of a hill. He stepped only
a pace or two into the room and then stood
still, looking at Dr. Littlepump, who was the
only other person who ventured to stand up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I have the honour,&#8221; said the stout
gentleman, making a low bow, &#8220;I believe I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
have the honour of addressing Dr. Littlepump.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor bowed but said nothing.</p>

<p>The stout gentleman continued, &#8220;If I had
not known it was impossible that anyone so
learned as Dr. Littlepump could allow anybody
to be insulted from the windows of his
house, I should have felt very angry on the
present occasion. It may have made merriment
for our young friends here; but it is a
serious thing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Dr. Littlepump, &#8220;it grieves me
that your feelings should have been hurt by
the laughter of these children. But, sir, I can
assure you no harm was meant by it. This is
holiday time, and, though you appear to be a
foreign gentleman, yet you are no doubt also
a gentleman who has seen much of the world,
and of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; no, Mr. Doctor!&#8221; exclaimed the
stout gentleman, &#8220;I have not seen much of
society. It is true, too true, that I am a foreigner,
in some respects, but from society the
misfortune of my birth has excluded me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pray, sir, do not concern yourself any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
further on this matter,&#8221; said Mrs. Littlepump,
in a courteous voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said the stout gentleman, &#8220;you
are too kind. It is such very amiable persons
as yourself, that reconcile me to my species&mdash;I
mean, to the human species. What have I
said? Not of my species would I willingly
speak. But in truth, madam, it is my own
knowledge of what I am, under my coat, that
makes me always fear my secret has been discovered.
I thought the children with their
little, quick eyes, always looking about, had
seen who it was that lived under this rough
coat I wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying the stout gentleman put one of
his fur gloves to his left eye and wiped away
a large tear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, my dear sir,&#8221; said Mrs. Littlepump,
&#8220;do take off your coat, and permit us to have
the pleasure of seeing you take a seat among
us round the stove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ye green woods, dark nights, and rocky
caves hidden with hanging weeds, why do I
so well remember ye!&#8221; exclaimed the stout
gentleman, clasping his fur gloves together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
&#8220;I will relieve my mind and tell you all. My
rough coat, the companion of my childhood,
and which has grown with my growth, I cannot
lay aside. It grows to my skin, madam.
My fur gloves are nature&#8217;s gift. They were
bought at no shop, Mrs. Littlepump. My
fur boots are as much a part of me as my
beard. Lady, I am, indeed, a foreigner, as to
society; I was born in no city, town, or village,
but in a cave full of dry leaves and soft twigs.
The truth is, I am not a man&mdash;but a <i>Bear</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he took off his comforter,
coat, and cap&mdash;and sure enough a Bear
he was, and one of the largest that was ever
seen!</p>

<p>In a very soft voice, so as scarcely to be
heard by anyone except the children who had
crowded around her, Margaret began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;There came a rough-faced Stranger</div>
<div class="indent">From the leafless winter woods.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The children heard Margaret sing, and ventured
to look up at the Bear. He continued
to stand near the door, and as he hadn&#8217;t the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
least sign of anything savage in his appearance,
their fear began to change to curiosity.
Two of the youngest had hidden themselves
in the folds of Mrs. Littlepump&#8217;s dress, and
little Val had crept under the table. But
when these found that nothing was going to
happen, and that the other children did not
cry out or seem terrified, they peeped out at
the Bear,&mdash;then they peeped again. At about
the seventh peep they all three left their hiding
places and crowded in among the rest&mdash;all
looking at the Bear!</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust,&#8221; said Dr. Littlepump, &#8220;that this
discovery&mdash;this casting off all disguise&mdash;produces
no change in the nature and habits you
have learned in civilized society. I feel sure
that I am addressing a gentleman, that is to
say, a most gentlemanly specimen of bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Banish all unkind suspicion from your
breast, Mr. Doctor,&#8221; said the Bear. &#8220;No one
ever need fear from me a single rude hug,&mdash;such
as my ancestors were too apt to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we feel quite satisfied,&#8221; said Mrs.
Littlepump, &#8220;that your conduct will be of the
very best kind. Pray take a seat near the fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
The children will all make room for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children all made room enough in a
trice, and more than enough, as they crowded
back as far as they could and left a large open
circle opposite the stove.</p>

<p>The Bear laid one paw upon his grateful
breast and advanced towards the fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to begin with warming my
nose,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>As the door of the stove was now closed, the
Bear bent his head down, and moved his nose
backwards and forwards in a sort of a semi-circle,
seeming to enjoy it very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;As my nose is very long,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the tip
of it is the first part that gets cold because
it is so far away from my face. I fear it may
not seem a well-shaped one, but it is a capital
smeller. I used to be able, when at a distance
of several miles, to smell&mdash;ahem!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the Bear checked himself suddenly.
He was going to say something about his life
at home in the woods that would not be
thought very nice in Dr. Littlepump&#8217;s parlour.
But he just caught himself up in time.
In doing this, however, his confusion at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
moment had made him neglect to observe that
a part of the stove was again red hot. He
came a little too close and all at once burnt the
tip of his nose!</p>

<p>The children would certainly have laughed,
but as the Bear started back he looked quickly
round the room. So everybody was afraid to
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have, no doubt, a very fine ear for
music,&#8221; said Mrs. Littlepump, wishing to relieve
the Bear from his embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, indeed, madam, a fine pair of ears,
though I know too well that they are rather
large as to size,&#8221; said the Bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means too large, sir,&#8221; answered Mrs.
Littlepump.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the whole world were hunted through
and through,&#8221; said the Bear, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we
should never find any other lady so amiable
in speaking graciously to one of the humblest
of her servants as Lady Littlepump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be proud, sir, to place you in the
list of our most particular friends. You are
so modest, so polite, so handsome a Bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mrs. Littlepump finished this last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
speech, the Bear looked at her for a moment&mdash;then
made three great steps backwards, and
made a deep bow. His bow was so very low,
and he remained so very long with his nose
pointing to the floor that all the children were
ready to die with laughter. Little Val fell
upon the floor trying to keep his laugh in, and
there he lay kicking, and Margaret, who had
covered her face with her handkerchief, was
heard to give a sort of a little scream; and
Nancy had run to the sofa, and covered her
head with one of the pillows.</p>

<p>At length the Bear raised his head. He
looked very pleasant even through all that
rough hair. Turning to Dr. Littlepump, he
said, &#8220;Mr. Dr. Littlepump, the extreme kindness
of this reception of one who is a stranger
wins me completely. If you permit me, I will
tell you the whole story of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this speech everybody said, &#8220;Do let us
hear the Bear&#8217;s story!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was agreed upon, with many thanks from
Dr. and Mrs. Littlepump. They placed a
large chair for the Bear in the middle of the
room. The Doctor took down Uncle Abraham&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Dutch pipe, filled it with the very best
Turkey tobacco and handed it to the Bear.
After carefully lighting it and taking a few
whiffs, and stopping a little while to think, the
Bear told the following story:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born in one of the largest caves in a
forest. My father and mother were regarded
not only by all other bears, but by every other
animal, as persons of some consequence. My
father was a person of proud and resentful disposition,
though of the greatest courage and
honour. But my mother was one in whom all
the qualities of the fairer sex were united. I
shall never forget the patience, the gentleness,
the skill, and the firmness with which she first
taught me to walk alone&mdash;I mean to walk on
all fours, of course; the upright manner of my
present walking was learned afterwards. As
this infant effort, however, is one of my very
earliest recollections, I will give you a little
account of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do, Mr. Bear,&#8221; cried Margaret. And
no sooner had she uttered the words, than all
the children cried out at the same time, &#8220;Oh,
please do, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The Bear took several long whiffs at his
pipe and thus continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother took me to a retired part of
the forest, and told me that I must now stand
alone. She slowly lowered me towards the
earth. The height as I looked down seemed
terrible, and I felt my legs kick in the air with
fear of I know not what. Suddenly I felt four
hard things, and no motion. It was the fixed
earth beneath my legs. &#8216;Now you are standing
alone!&#8217; said my mother. But what she said
I heard as in a dream. My back was in the
air, my nose was poking out straight, snuffing
the fresh breezes, my ears were pricking and
shooting with all sorts of new sounds, to wonder
at, to want to have, to love, or to tumble
down at,&mdash;and my eyes were staring before me
full of light and dancing things. Soon the
firm voice of my mother came to my assistance,
and I heard her tell me to look upon the
earth beneath me, and see where I was.</p>

<p>First I looked up among the boughs, then
sideways at my shoulder, then I squinted at
the tip of my nose, then I bent my nose in despair,
and saw my fore paws standing. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
first thing I saw distinctly was a little blue
flower with a bright jewel in the middle,&mdash;a
dewdrop. The next thing I saw upon the
ground was a soft-looking little creature, that
crawled alone with a round ball upon the middle
of its back. It was of a beautiful white
colour with brown and red curling stripes.
The creature moved very, very slowly, and appeared
always to follow two long horns on its
head, that went feeling about on all sides.
Presently, it approached my right fore paw,
and I wondered how I should feel, or smell, or
hear it, as it went over my toes. But the instant
one of the horns touched the hair of my paw,
both horns shrank into nothing, and presently
came out again, and the creature slowly moved
away in another direction. I wondered at this
strange action&mdash;for I never thought of hurting
the creature, not knowing how to hurt anything.
While I was wondering what made the
horn think I should hurt it, my attention was
suddenly drawn to a tuft of moss on my right
near a hollow tree trunk. Out of this green
tuft looked a pair of very bright, small, round
eyes which were staring up at me. I stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
looking at the eyes, and, presently, I saw that
the head was yellow, and all the face and
throat yellow, and that it had a large mouth.</p>

<p>&#8216;What you saw a little while ago,&#8217; said my
mother, &#8216;we call a snail. And what we see
now we call a frog.&#8217;</p>

<p>The names, however, did not help me at all
to understand. Why the first should have
turned from my paw so suddenly, and why this
creature should continue to stare up at me in
such a manner puzzled me very much. I now
observed that its body and breast were double
somehow, and that its paws had no hair upon
them. I thought this was no doubt caused by
its slow crawling which had probably rubbed
it all off. Suddenly, a beam of bright light
broke through the trees and this creature gave
a great hop right under my nose and I, thinking
the world was at an end, instantly fell flat
down on one side and lay there waiting!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this all the children laughed; they were so
delighted. The Bear laughed, too, and soon
went on with his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you these things,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in as clear
a manner as I can, that you may rightly understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
them. My dear mother caught me up in
her arms, saying, &#8216;Oh, thou small bear! thou
hast fallen flat down, on first seeing a frog
hop.&#8217;</p>

<p>The next day my mother gave me my first
lesson in walking. She took me to a nice,
smooth, sandy place in the forest, not far from
home, and setting me down carefully, said,
&#8216;Walk.&#8217; But I remained just where I was.</p>

<p>If a child with only <i>two</i> legs feels puzzled
which leg it should move first, judge of the
many puzzles of a young bear under such circumstances.
Said I to myself, &#8216;Shall I move
my right front paw first or my left; or my
right hind leg or my left? Shall I first move
the two front legs both at the same time, then
the two hind legs; or my two hind legs first,
and then my two front legs? Shall I move
the right front leg, and the right hind leg at
the same time; or the left front leg and the
right hind leg? Shall I try to move all four
at once, and how, and which way? Or shall I
move three legs at once, in order to push myself
on, while one leg remains for me to balance
my body upon; and if so, which three legs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
should move and which one should be the leg
to balance upon?&#8217; Amidst all these confusing
thoughts and feelings, I was afraid to move in
any way. I believe I should have been standing
there to this day, had not my mother, with
a slow bowing and bending motion of the head
and backbone, gracefully passed and repassed
me several times, saying, &#8216;Do <i>so</i>, child!&mdash;leave
off thinking, and walk!&#8217;</p>

<p>My mother was right. As soon as I left
off thinking about it, I found myself walking.
Oh, what a wonderful and clever young gentleman
I found myself! I went plowing along
with such a serious face upon the ground! I
soon ran my head against one or two trees, and
a bit of rock, each of which I saw very well
before I did so; but I thought they would get
out of my way or slip aside, or that my head
would go softly through them. My mother,
therefore, took me up and carried me till we
arrived within a short distance of our cave. In
front of it there was a large space of high,
green grass, through which a regular path had
been worn by the feet of my father and mother.
At the beginning of this path, my mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
placed me on the ground, and told me I must
walk to the cave along the pathway all by myself.
This was a great task for me. I thought
I should never be able to keep in such a
straight line. I felt dizzy as I looked first on
one side, and then on the other, expecting
every instant to tumble over into the high,
green grass, on the right or left. However, I
managed to get to the cave without any accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Bear finished the last sentence he
suddenly rose, and drew out from beneath a
thick tuft of hair on his right side, a very large
watch, with a broad gold face and a tortoise-shell
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; said he, hurrying on his short
cloak, his cap, and comforter, &#8220;for it is nearly
ten o&#8217;clock, and before I go to bed I have some
work to do. But I will come again to-morrow
night and finish my story. Mrs. Littlepump,
I am your respectful and grateful, humble
servant! Mr. Dr. Littlepump, I am also
yours. Good-night to you, Miss Nancy, and to
you, little Val, and to you, pretty Miss
Margaret, and to all my young friends, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the rest. May you all sleep well, and with
happy dreams!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; cried all the children in a
loud chorus. &#8220;Oh, be sure to come to-morrow
evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Mr. Bear!&#8221; cried everybody,
while the stout gentleman bustled, and hustled,
and rustled, and scuffled out of the room, and
along the passage, and out of the street-door,
and into the street, where he was soon lost sight
of in the snow which was now falling very
fast.</p>


<h3><i>Second Evening</i></h3>

<p>The next evening, about dusk, all the children
who had been visiting Nancy and Valentine
came again in a troop, scrambling and
crowding at the door to get in first. They
were so anxious to hear the remainder of the
Bear&#8217;s story. As they all came into the room,
they cried out, &#8220;Is he come?&mdash;When will he
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Littlepump walked up and down the
room with an air of serious anxiety; anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
could see he had something on his mind. Mrs.
Littlepump also said more than once that she
hoped no accident would happen on the road
to prevent the coming of Mr. Bear. Margaret
now became very anxious and fidgetty, and
looked at Uncle Abraham, as though she was
a little vexed at his indifference about the
event in which everybody else took so much
interest. Dorothea, Lydia, and Wallis, all
said they, for their parts, had been unable to
sleep all last night for thinking of the stout
gentleman&#8217;s story. But nothing of all this
seemed to move Uncle Abraham, who sat
smoking his Dutch pipe and twinkling his
eyes. Presently, however, the clock struck
five, and he rose from his chair, saying he
must go and make a little visit a few doors off
before he went to bed. They all begged him
very hard to stay and see Mr. Bear, but he
shook his head, and said, &#8220;Pooh&#8221; and walked
away. Margaret looked pleased when he was
gone, but the children said it was very naughty
of him not to stay.</p>

<p>Margaret said, &#8220;Let us play a little game
until Mr. Bear arrives.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said all the children.</p>

<p>They began to play the game, but they did
not attend to it. Their minds were too much
filled with the expectation of Mr. Bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do hope the gentleman Bear will be
sure to come,&#8221; cried little Val.</p>

<p>As he said this they very plainly heard the
sound of a horse&#8217;s hoofs coming up the street.
They all ran to the window. What was their
surprise and delight to see that it was the Bear
on horseback! As the horse stopped before
Dr. Littlepump&#8217;s door, the stout gentleman in
the rough coat bent forward, then let himself
slowly down, hanging carefully till his fur
boots touched the ground. At this all the children
burst out laughing; but instantly recollecting
themselves, they ran away from the
windows, and scrambled into seats round the
stove, coughing a little, to pretend it had been
only that. And now a knock was heard at the
door and a loud ring! Margaret ran and
opened the door and in came the Bear.</p>

<p>Everybody was so glad to see him. Wallis
and Margaret helped him to take off his cloak
and comforter. Mrs. Littlepump begged him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to take a seat near the stove. Dorothea presented
him with a large cup of nice coffee, hot,
and strong, and very sweet, and Dr. Littlepump
handed him Uncle Abraham&#8217;s pipe.</p>

<p>Everybody being now comfortably settled,
the Bear rose from his chair, and, bowing all
round, looked at Dr. Littlepump and said,
&#8220;Mr. Dr. Littlepump, let me know what is the
wish of our young friends here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Good-Natured Bear!&#8221; cried
Nancy, &#8220;do please continue your delightful
story!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bear laid one paw upon his heart,&mdash;bowed&mdash;sat
down&mdash;and after looking thoughtfully
into the bowl of his pipe for a few minutes,
as if to collect his ideas, thus continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;At the foot of our cave, there was, as I have
told you, a plot of high, green grass with a
path through it up to the entrance. At the
back of the rock in which the cave was, there
grew several fine old oak trees, and some young
elms, all promising to become very tall and
beautiful. My father was very fond of walking
alone among those fine trees.</p>

<p>One afternoon he was taking a nap on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
bed of leaves in the cave, when he was aroused
by a noise at the back of the rock, among the
trees. The sound was that of a number of
hard blows one after another. My father went
to see what it was, and there he saw a woodman
with an axe cutting down the young elms.
In perfect rage, my father ran towards the
man, who instantly scampered away as fast as
he could, crying out: &#8216;Oh! Oh! Oh!&#8217;</p>

<p>The next morning as soon as it was light the
same noise was heard again among the trees.
Up jumped my father, but my mother, fearing
some danger, went with him. It was a good
thing she did so, as the forester had brought
his two sons with loaded guns to watch for my
father while the woodman was at work. My
mother saw the two youths each hiding behind
a large tree and she begged my father, both for
her sake and mine, to come away. At last he
did so, though not without much gruffness and
grumbling.</p>

<p>By the evening the woodman had cut down
about a third part of the young elms. Then he
went away, intending to come and carry them
off in the morning. My mother tried to persuade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
my father not to interfere because it was
too near our home. But my father said they
were <i>his</i> trees and he could not bear to lose
them. So at night he collected all the trees
that were cut down, and carried them, one or
two at a time, to a river, at a short distance,
where the current was strong, and threw them
in with a great splash. Long before morning
the current had carried them all far away.</p>

<p>The next day the woodman came with his
two sons, a team of horses, and ropes to drag
the trees away. But there was not one to be
seen! After wondering and sitting under an
oak for an hour, the woodman again went to
work with his axe and cut down more young
elm trees. He sent one son back with the
horses, as they were needed for the plow.</p>

<p>In the evening the woodman went away as
before, leaving the trees, and thinking no one
would steal them a second time. But at night
my father went as before and threw them all
into the river. In the morning the woodman
came again with the team. &#8216;What!&#8217; cried he,
&#8216;All gone again!&mdash;it must be the work of some
fairy! Thieves could never carry away clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
out of sight all those heavy young trees,&mdash;unless,
indeed, it were the Forty Thieves, for it
would need as many.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again the woodman cut down the trees and
now there was not an elm left standing. He
went away in the evening, as before, leaving
the trees upon the ground. My father was sallying
out to carry them off in the same way as
before when my mother said, &#8216;Do <i>not</i> go, Benjamin
(we always spoke in Bear language,
you know, and not as I talk to you), do <i>not</i> go
to-night, Benjamin, I beg you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, that unfeeling rascal has cut down
all my young elms and the next thing you know
he will cut down my oaks. I will <i>not</i> endure
it,&#8217; said my father angrily.</p>

<p>&#8216;But this is by no means certain,&#8217; reasoned
my mother. &#8216;He seems to want only the elms.
And at the worst we could find another cave
with oaks near it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But not with oaks and a nice river, too!&#8217;
said my father.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then the child (meaning me) and I must
go with you and help to do it as quickly as
possible. After it is done we will go and sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
for a few nights in the forest over the northern
hills, for my mind is very uneasy about matters,&#8217;
said my mother.</p>

<p>My father laughed and said &#8216;GOOFF-ZUGDT,&#8217;
which, in Bear language, means
&#8216;Nonsense!&#8217;</p>

<p>So we all went out of the cave and worked
away at a great rate. My father and mother
carried the largest of the young trees, and I
such of the smallest as my tender years would
allow. By midnight we had just finished and
my father was carrying the last tree, when suddenly
a shout was heard and we saw a flash of
torches! The trees had been seen floating
downstream, by some men who were coming
to watch for the thieves, or to see if it was the
work of fairies.</p>

<p>&#8216;Cross the stream, higher up, and run for
the northern hills,&#8217; shouted my mother. At
the same time she seized me by one ear in her
mouth and lugged me along till we came to
the river bank. Instantly she soused me into
the water. When I came to the surface, I instantly
felt my ear again in my mother&#8217;s warm
mouth, and we soon landed on the other side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
My father was not with us. We took it for
granted that he had run in some other direction,
and would rejoin us shortly. The shouts,
however, followed us and so did the men with
torches. My mother never once looked behind,
but ran, lugging me along by one ear,
through fields and woods, up hill and down
dale. At last she laid me on some warm leaves
under thick bushes. But my father did not
join us. We never saw him again. He was
captured and taken to the village.</p>

<p>My poor father was now lost to us; therefore,
my mother set herself busily to work at
my education. She divided every day into various
portions; and although a large share was
given to amusement in which I played with
several young bears of my own age, and had
sometimes a gambol with other young animals,
still there was nothing that gave me more
pleasure than the lessons I received from her.
For this purpose she would generally take me
into some quiet part of the wood. There,
under a wide-spreading tree, she taught my
young ideas &#8216;how to shoot!&#8217; One lesson in particular,
I remember, as she took great pains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
to impress it on my memory. I have followed
the idea in all my conduct through life and I
can truly say with the best results to myself. I
will recite for you the verse which tells the lesson
she taught</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">Oh! thou small Bear,</div>
<div class="indent2">Learn to bear, and forbear,</div>
<div class="verse">And of good luck, or good friends, never despair.</div>
</div></div>

<p>A few days after I had received this lesson,
I found myself placed in a situation which
needed the good advice of the little verse. An
extremely well-behaved young pig, and a very
merry little fox, with whom I was playing,
asked me what I had been doing the other day
near a certain hollow tree. I told them I often
collected acorns there in the morning and went
in the evening to eat them. They said no
more, and we went on playing round about the
trees&mdash;and sometimes climbing up them&mdash;that
is&mdash;the merry little fox and I did this. The
young wild pig could not. But after that day,
whenever I collected acorns in the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and put them into the hollow tree, and then
went at night to eat them, they were all gone!</p>

<p>One evening, however, as I was returning
home after my disappointment and wondering
who it could be, I heard a laughing in the
thickets, and entering suddenly there I saw the
little fox and my friend the wild pig who
were just going to run away when they saw
me. They both looked very foolish as our eyes
met. So the thought struck me that they were
the thieves, and I at once accused them. The
wild pig became angry and denied that he had
stolen a single acorn. He said he would not be
called a thief by anybody. The little fox said
he had never eaten a single acorn in all his
life, nor had his father before him. Also, he
said he would not be called a glutton by anybody.</p>

<p>On hearing this I understood how it all
was. &#8216;Jemmy,&#8217; said I, fixing my eyes upon
the little fox, &#8216;Jemmy! you know very well
that you stole my acorns. We have often
played together and this is the first bad trick
you have served me. You know I am quite
able to punish you severely, and take your tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
away from you. But I forgive you this time.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then I turned to the young wild pig and
said, &#8216;Hugo, you have <i>eaten</i> my acorns. You
know that I am stronger than you, that I could
throw my arms around your neck and give
you <i>such</i> a one! (meaning a hard hug)&mdash;but I
forbear for the sake of our old friendship. I
feel sure this will never happen again, and, no
doubt, we shall all be better friends than
ever.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this, the little fox shed a great many
tears, and continued to rub his eyes with his
little yellow brush for five minutes afterwards.
The wild young pig stood silently for some
time, as if he were trying to understand all
about it. When he did speak it was only &#8216;<i>ouff</i>&#8217;&mdash;but
I thought he felt what I had said.</p>

<p>At night, when we were going to bed, I
told the whole story to my mother. She said
I had acted rightly, according to what she had
taught me in the verse. &#8216;For what,&#8217; said she,
&#8216;would have been the use of beating and
squeezing the young thieves? It would not
have brought back the acorns, and would have
made them both enemies in the future, ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to steal anything. But as it is you have got two
friends, and lost nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>After thinking a moment, I said, &#8216;Yes,
Mother, but I&#8217;ve lost my acorns!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They are not more lost than if you had
eaten them,&#8217; said my mother. &#8216;When a thing
is eaten, it is lost. All you have to complain of
is that the wild young pig ate them for you.
But as you have forgiven him of course you
ought to think no more of the matter. Act
thus through life toward your fellow creatures.
Do so for the sake of the verse I taught
you, and trust to nature for good results.
Now, child, go to sleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>In this manner I passed my early youth and
was just coming to my full size and strength
when the dreadful thing happened which I
spoke of when I first had the honour of talking
to the present company. It was the terrible
thing which made me an orphan in the world.</p>

<p>We were greeted one evening by a very
ragged but wise old ape who had managed to
escape from the menagerie in the big city. He
was disguised as a Chinese tea-merchant, and
he begged a night&#8217;s lodging, as he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
himself out of all danger. He told us news
about my poor father. He was put in a menagerie
in the village and there he grieved
himself to death.</p>

<p>My mother never recovered after this sad
news. She made no complaint, nor did she appear
to give way to grief, but she gradually
sank, and sank. Her feet failed her and her
teeth fell out. One night, in a more than usually
affectionate manner she had her last talk
with me. She told me to act always with honesty,
truth, and good feeling towards everyone;
to bear all injuries and misfortunes as firmly as
I could. She begged me in all dealings to
keep from feelings of revenge and hatred.
She then gave me an embrace, and told me to
sleep well, and remember her words. In the
morning I found her lying dead upon the
moist green grass, with her head gently resting
upon one paw.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Bear uttered these last words, he
seemed overcome with many feelings and
thoughts of other years. Then, suddenly rising
from his chair, he hastily put on his hat
and cloak, and hurried out of the room. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
friends heard the sound of the street-door closing,
and two of the children ran on tiptoe to
the window; but he was out of sight.</p>


<h3><i>Third Evening</i></h3>

<p>The next evening the children all met again,
in the hope that the Good-Natured Bear
would come to finish his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so much afraid he will never come
again,&#8221; said Nancy. &#8220;What <i>shall</i> we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>shall</i> we do?&#8221; echoed all the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my part, I think that he will come,&#8221;
said Mrs. Littlepump.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I hope so,&#8221; said Margaret.
&#8220;Dear, how my heart beats!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your heart beats for Mr. Bear?&#8221; said Dr.
Littlepump, looking hard at Margaret, who
instantly blushed up to her eyes, and her ears
were as red as ripe cherries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do so wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said little Valentine,
and then he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you wish, Valentine?&#8221; asked Mr.
Doctor, looking at his watch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;I wish we had Jemmy here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jemmy! what Jemmy?&#8221; inquired Mr. Doctor
with a serious face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jemmy, the merry little fox with the
yellow brush tail!&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>At this moment the clock struck six, and
without any knocking, or ringing, or any other
announcement, the parlour door opened and in
walked Mr. Bear!</p>

<p>He bowed with his usual politeness; but
he had a more than usual air of gravity and
some appearance of anxiety. Margaret placed
his chair for him and this seemed to please
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Miss Margaret,&#8221; said he, and
he soon became cheerful.</p>

<p>Looking around with a smile, and particularly
at Margaret, he asked if he might go on
with his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do, Sir!&mdash;please do!&#8221; cried a dozen
voices at once. So he continued as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must now tell you about my own captivity,
and I fear there were several times when
I did not follow my mother&#8217;s advice but really
lost my temper for some minutes. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
scarcely reached my full growth when a party
of hunters came to the forest where I lived
and surprising me while I was asleep, caught
me fast in a very strong rope net. I made a
great struggle. Three of the hunters stepped
a few paces back and leveled their guns with
the intention of shooting me. At this moment
an immense wild pig rushed out of a thicket
and crying &#8216;ouff!&#8217; charged right upon the three
hunters&mdash;knocked them all three flat upon
their backs like ninepins&mdash;and then dashed
into the thicket on the opposite side! Up
jumped the three hunters, very angry, and instantly
fired their guns into the thicket after
the wild pig. But he was out of their reach.
Another of the hunters was now about to thrust
his spear at me when suddenly he gave a loud
cry, and flung his spear at a tree, close to the
foot of which we saw a large yellow and red
brush tail whisk round.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; cried the hunter. &#8216;Some rascal of a
fox has bitten me in the foot!&#8217;</p>

<p>I need not tell you who these two forest
friends were who had thus saved my life. You
have already guessed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;Jemmy and Hugo,&#8221; whispered the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jemmy and Hugo, grown up!&#8221; nodded Mr.
Bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hunters now began to talk together
about whether I might not be of more value
to them alive in a menagerie than if they killed
me. They spoke of my rich, bright, brown-coloured
fur, my large size, my youth. At length
they decided to send me to a menagerie. Some
of them said that a live bear was a great
trouble on a long journey.</p>

<p>I now saw that it was of no use to make any
further struggle among so many armed men,
so I became very quiet. The cords that bound
me had become partially loose at the arms.
The son of the hunter, who had been about to
kill me with his spear, happened to come close
to me. I slowly freed one paw and instead
of seizing the boy roughly, I slowly raised
myself to an upright position behind his back
and then patted him gently upon the top of his
head. This surprised, amused, and won the
hearts of all the hunters. They said it was
quite impossible to kill such a <i>good-natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
bear</i>, and from that day they called me <i>The
Good-Natured Bear</i>.</p>

<p>I remember very well an event of my journey
with my captors, which led to my learning
to dance. We were all seated in a pleasant
wood at sunset. One of the men drew forth
a clarionet, another a horn and began to play.
For the first time in my life I heard what you
call music. I was filled with joy, and, being
quite unable to control myself, I rose on my
hind legs of my own accord, and stepped in
time to the music. At this the hunters loosened
the ropes which held me and gave me
more freedom. In this upright position I
stepped to the middle of an open green space
and continued to keep time to the merry tune
which was played. The hunters shouted and
laughed and laughed and shouted. The music
became faster and louder. Round and round
I waltzed, and the trees all began to dance
round me, too. Then the green ground span
round about, carrying all the hunters and the
music in a swift, dizzy circle round me. I
feared I was going mad and I determined to
save myself. Therefore, I collected all my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
willpower and stopped turning. The instant
I stood still, the ground slipped from beneath
my feet, and away I rolled to the bottom of a
hill, where I fell asleep.</p>

<p>From this time, I continually practised
walking upright. At first it was very difficult
to walk for any distance on my hind feet. I
could not help bending my nose and looking
all down my right side, then all down my left
side, and so from side to side, for I seemed
such a height above the ground. Also, in order
to keep my balance, I was obliged to give
my weight first on one leg, then on the other,
without lifting them from the ground.</p>

<p>My captors took me to a menagerie, where
I was more than comfortable. My food was
very good and my water was always clear and
fresh. I also had far more liberty than any
other animal. I believe this kindness was
shown me because I showed no anger or hatred
towards anyone, also, I was very careful not to
frighten or hurt any of the children, who came
near me.</p>

<p>In time I became the principal object of
attraction in this menagerie. Crowds came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
daily and stood in front of my cell and looked,
and pointed, and often spoke to me till at last
I came to see that I was regarded as a surprising
example of wisdom, although I did not
understand one word they spoke to me, except
when they also made signs. Sometimes, however,
I was able to connect sounds with signs,
so that I actually learned the meaning of many
words. Then first came to me the great desire
to learn human speech. I thought since I
had learned the meaning of many words why
could I not learn many more? And when I
had learned certain sounds thoroughly why
could I not imitate those words, so as to speak
as well as understand?</p>

<p>I determined to do this if possible and I
studied very hard. I listened very carefully
all day to those whom I heard speaking and
at night I practised my voice. At first I could
make no sound at all like words, but only
strange noises, so that it woke some of the animals,
who made a great grumbling, and three
of the monkeys mocked me for a week after,
chattering, pointing, and making mouths at
me. However, I went on trying, and at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
end of four years, I understood nearly all that
was said to me, even without signs, and could
pronounce a number of words very well,
though, of course, with rather a foreign accent.
I proved this to myself upon two or
three occasions, when it was dark and no one
knew where the voice came from. By the answers
I received I always found that what I
had said was understood. Nevertheless, I kept
all this a secret.</p>

<p>By this time I was made a show of by myself,
and separated from all the other animals
in one large corner, which was parted off by
a green curtain in front. An additional price
was charged to see me. I did not know what
in the world they might do with me, if they
found they possessed a Bear who could talk!
I often longed to be free. I was very tired
indeed of this kind of crowding and staring
life, and I longed for the beautiful quiet of
my native woods. But there seemed no hope
of escape.</p>

<p>In the ninth year of my captivity and, I
may add, of my private studies, I was sent
round the country in a caravan with three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
keepers who made a great deal of money by
me, at the various fairs and markets. I was
called on the placards outside, &#8216;The Intellectual
Bear!&#8217;</p>

<p>There was also another captive in the caravan,&mdash;a
large serpent. I tried to be friendly
with him but he never noticed me. He was
usually asleep, rolled up on a heap of blankets,
in a box. When he was awake his eyes
were generally shut, and he seemed in a sort
of a stupid trance so that we formed no acquaintance.
I longed more than ever for my
liberty.</p>

<p>One night&mdash;it was a hot night in June&mdash;after
a long journey, while our keepers were
away at supper the serpent broke open his box.
Presently his head went slowly gliding up to
one of the windows, and moved all over the
inside shutter. It had not been properly
locked, and it opened a little way. Upon this,
the serpent raised himself upwards by his
mouth, opening the shutter gradually as he
rose, till he had coiled about half his body up
against the window-frame, and then, with a
slow pressure&mdash;he burst it open. The next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
moment he dropped silently through the opening&mdash;and
was gone!</p>

<p>In an instant the thought of liberty flashed
through my mind! I grasped the wooden bars
of my cell, with both arms, and crushed three
of them together. I jumped down upon the
floor of the caravan, and scrambled up to the
window. It was too small to let my body
through, but I tore away the framework and
out I got, and leaped down upon fresh, cool
grass in the fresh, cool, night air! Oh, what
delight after that steaming hot caravan! I
ran off as fast as I could. A few stars were
shining. Luckily there was no moon. Our
caravan had fortunately been fixed outside the
town, so that I had no gates to pass through.
I scampered along, dodging between the trees
of the avenue just as if I had been pursued,
though not a soul was to be seen at that hour;
then I cut across some fields and reached a
vineyard. Scrambling on through garden
and orchard and wood, I came to the highroad
which led to a large city. Again I plunged
into some vineyards till suddenly I came to a
great river which I swam quickly across and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
landed a little above a village. Again I lost
myself in the vineyards, but I did the best I
could to avoid villages and pathways leading
to towns, for I feared I might meet a party
of travelers who would make it known where
they had seen me. I knew there would be a
wide search for me. So I made my way upward
towards some distant mountains. At last
I came to a forest where the trees were very
large. Up one of them I slowly climbed, being
careful not to scrape or leave any marks
upon the bark of the tree. Choosing a snug
place where several large boughs crossed each
other, I bent some of the smaller ones round
about, so that I was carefully hidden from all
eyes below.</p>

<p>The next morning, as I was sure would be
the case, I heard all sorts of noises of hunters
and dogs all over the country. Several parties
passed directly beneath the tree where I
was seated. I heard one of the dogs give such
a sniff. Oh! how closely I hugged the trunk
of that tree, with my nose pointing up the
stem, and not once venturing to look down! I
hoped with all my heart not to be seen. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
search continued for several days round about
me. I never descended and I had nothing to
eat. Once it rained in the night, and I drank
the water off the leaves, taking whole bunches
at a time into my mouth. This quite refreshed
me. Nobody ever found me out, except that
one morning an old crow with a bright, black
eye, came and peeped at me, but as soon as he
saw who it was he flew away, crying out,
&#8216;<i>Lawk! Lawk!</i>&#8217;</p>

<p>At length the search after me was continued
in other parts of the country, and one night
I came down to stretch my legs, and sniff about
a bit, and see what the world was made of&mdash;ahem!
I had not walked far before I came
to a spot where the hunters had paused to rest
and refresh themselves. Here I found two
things which had been dropped by some accident&mdash;namely,
a purse with some money in it
and a very large pork pie! The purse I placed
in a thicket under a stone, but I had immediate
need of the pie. I ate half of it that night; I
was so very hungry. The remainder I carried
with me up the tree, and made it last five days.</p>

<p>Though I never stopped watching or forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
my caution, the fear I at first had of
being discovered and recaptured was very
much lessened, so that my mind was free to
follow its own course of self-improvement. I
continued to practice speaking with the greatest
care, repeating all the sentences I knew,
and every word I could recollect. I did this
so often in order to master the pronunciation
that sometimes when I ceased I had a pain in
my lower jaw, which lasted for half an hour.
However, I continually persevered. I had
now practised speaking a human language for
nearly twelve years. I spoke very badly I
knew; still, I had sometimes found what I said
in the dark when I was in the menagerie, had
been understood and I was full of hope. How
and in what manner to make my first appearance
among mankind, was quite a puzzle to
me. One preparation as to my personal appearance
I knew I must make. I grieved at
it. I objected to the narrowness of mind
which I knew made it necessary,&mdash;yet I knew
also that it must be done.</p>

<p>In the early morning of the world, everything
was new and wonderful beyond all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
doubt; but not more new and wonderful than
useful and necessary to carry out the future
business of creation. Who can deny the high
origin of tails? The first animal who was active
and well-formed must have had a tail.
Of its great importance it would take too much
time at present to speak. But even in these
modern times how much use and ornament it
possesses must be seen by everybody when they
think of the lion, the dog, the eagle, the swallow,
the monkey, the squirrel, and the fish.
Running, leaping, flying, swimming are all
helped very much indeed by the tail. Of its
use as a fan in sultry weather, as a whisker-away
of gnats and flies, I will make no mention.
Then, what a tail the beaver has and
who is more skilful than he? I will stop.
You see I have no tail. Since I had made up
my mind to live with mankind it was necessary
to accept most of their customs. In short,
I found I must give up my tail. This I did at
the sacrifice of some private feelings, I assure
you.</p>

<p>You must be curious, I think, to hear how
I made my first appearance among the circles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of mankind, and I will hasten to tell you.
Most fortunately, I had a little money, the
value of which I knew pretty well. I made
my way cautiously across the country into a
town one dark evening of a market-day, and
with my money I managed to purchase a large
pair of shoes, a pair of cow-skin gloves, a
piece of gingerbread, and a sheet of white
paper. With these materials I made my way
to a large city where a great fair was being
held.</p>

<p>I chose a dark corner on the outskirts of
the fair and spread my sheet of white paper
upon the ground. On this white paper I
placed a score of gingerbread pills, and, with
beating heart and shaking limbs, I addressed
the human race on the subject of pills, for I
had heard people were very much interested
in this subject. I was so alarmed at speaking
to a group of such wise beings that even at the
time I did not well know what I was saying.
However, the moment I began to speak, a
number of persons came round me and
laughed loudly. I thought I was found out,
and stopped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8216;Go on, Doctor! Go on!&#8217; cried they. So
I went on. A crowd soon collected, all of
whom laughed very much, saying, &#8216;What a
voice! Look at his nose! Did you ever hear
such language! What a figure!&#8217;</p>

<p>They bought all my gingerbread pills in
a very short time, and I was only able to make
my escape by telling them I must go to my
lodgings for some more.</p>

<p>Oh, how shall I describe the joy and exultation
I felt at the great success of my experiment
upon the wise and generous human race!
I was obliged to double the price of my gingerbread
pills in order to prevent them from
going so fast. Everything I said produced
immense laughter, even when I myself knew
I had said no witty or sensible thing at all,
while any ordinary reply was received with
shouts of applause. They believed that my
strange voice, dialect, face, figure, and behaviour
were all a part of my make-up, and
that I was acting a part! In fact, they thought
I could speak and appear very differently, if I
liked. I did not feel altogether pleased at this
discovery; but I was obliged to take what came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and make the most of it. I, therefore, spoke
as well as I could, and when I made some
shocking blunder, I allowed the people to suppose
that I knew better.</p>

<p>I now took my position in society. I had
lodgings in a house, and I slept in a bed! I
shall never forget the first night I slept in a
bed. How I stood looking at the snow-white
luxury! and walked round it softly, holding
my breath. I touched it very gently, but at
last I did muster courage and actually got
between the sheets!</p>

<p>I visited other large fairs with increased
success, so that in the course of a year or two
I had gained a great sum of money.</p>

<p>I soon became famous at all the great fairs
where, by some, I was called the Whimsical
Doctor, on account of my odd dress, face, and
voice, all of which people regarded as my
make-up. Several wealthy people whom I
met at these fairs offered to go into partnership
with me. At last I consented. I took as
my partner a clever man named Tobias, who
was a jeweller. He sold all his jewels, or
rather, he turned all his jewels into gingerbread,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and we made wagon-loads of gingerbread
pills. In making the large quantities
of these, however, Tobias talked to me in a
way which caused me to feel, for the first time,
that this method of dealing with the human
race was not honourable. I began to see that
human beings were not so wise as I had imagined,
and that nobody ought to cheat them.
The more my partner talked over our success
the more I felt we were rogues. So one morning
I told him that I wished to dissolve our
partnership. &#8216;Ah,&#8217; said he, &#8216;then, as you leave
me, of course you will leave with me all the
stock in trade, and all the money, too.&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;not all the money. Take all the pills,
and welcome; but give me back half the
money.&#8217; He refused. We spoke sharply to
each other and suddenly he said to me, angrily,
&#8216;You shall have nothing. If you say anything
more I will tell what I have found out about
you. I know what you are. You are not a
man&mdash;but a <i>bear</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck! I fell back into my
infant years as if I had fallen over a cliff. I
felt I was a bear! But the next moment I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
seized Tobias in my arms, and lifted him up
in the air, saying in a loud voice: &#8216;Wicked fellow!
what shall I do to you?&#8217; At this moment,
however, I recollected my mother&#8217;s
words. I set him down upon the ground,
where he stood quite breathless with fright.
Then I said to him, &#8216;Ungrateful man&mdash;dishonest
partner,&mdash;take my money and go thy ways
in peace.&#8217;</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do, and certainly not
knowing what to think, I wandered about the
country. Sometimes I sat under hedges and
puzzled my brains to understand what sort of
thing human reason was. I never could make
it out. However, I knew that I was an imposter,&mdash;though
an innocent imposter, since
I could not help wearing a fur coat and a long
nose.</p>

<p>One day when I was seated under a tree,
eating a turnip, who should pass by but
Tobias, all in rags, and looking very ill. Suddenly,
he saw me, uttered a cry, and fell down
in a fit. I went to him and placed the cool
wet leaves of my turnip across his temples.
This seemed to revive him and do him good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
When he saw that I had no intention to hurt
him he asked me to carry him to the nearest
peasant&#8217;s cottage. I did so and was going
away when he called me back and said, &#8216;I
behaved very badly to you, but I was punished.
When you left me nobody would buy
the pills. The people called loudly for the
Wonderful Doctor with the fur coat and the
large nose who talked so oddly. As you were
not to be found, they said I was a rascal, and
an impostor, and they drove me out of the
town. I was quite ruined. They seized all
our pills and flung them about and the boys
pelted each other with pill-boxes in the streets
for at least three hours. The very same wonderful
pills the world had just before been
running after.&#8217;</p>

<p>In a few months after this Tobias had a
fortune left him by a relation. He sent for
me, begged my pardon for his previous behaviour,
set me up in business as a merchant,
and took great pains to instruct me. In the
winter I dealt in pickles and preserves; and in
the summer I carried on a wholesale trade in
silks and velvets. He wanted me to sell furs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
also, but I declined that. These occupations I
have followed ever since, with great industry
and good success. Meantime, however, at all
leisure hours I have tried to improve my mind
by various studies, and, among others, I even
managed to make some progress in mathematics.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Bear said this, all the children
thought directly of Uncle Abraham, the
mathematician, and were so sorry he was not
present to hear about these studies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should now,&#8221; continued the stout gentleman,
&#8220;consider myself very happy, but for
one circumstance. I confess I do not like to
mention it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">How can this small heart contain</div>
<div class="verse">So large a world of joy and pain;</div>
<div class="verse">And how can this small tongue declare</div>
<div class="verse">All that is felt so deeply there!</div>
<div class="verse">Alas, poor Bear!&mdash;Alas, poor Bear!</div>
</div></div>

<p>You will all readily understand that to
have raised myself by my own efforts so much
above the rest of my species, I must have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
a nature open to many thoughts and feelings;
and that the peculiar tenderness instilled by
my mother had grown with my growth, and
made me open to all the softer emotions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bear here paused and gave a deep sigh.
Several of the younger children sighed too.
Gretchen fixed her eyes upon the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not aware for some time,&#8221; said the
sorrowful gentleman in the rough coat, &#8220;of
what kind of feelings had begun to possess me.
I felt I was alone in the world. I had long
felt that,&mdash;but I had so much to do, so much
to learn and struggle with, and work at, and
so much travelling about and business to attend
to, that I did not feel this being alone as
any great grief. Besides, as I had been successful
in the various difficult things I had
attempted, and had for a long time been very
fortunate in all my affairs of business, I was
in the habit of regarding myself as a happy
person. And I <i>was</i> happy, until I began to
think that others were more so, and then I saw
it was because others, who were happy, could
share it with those they loved and also give
happiness to the dear object. But I was alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
in the world. I had nobody to love. Nobody
would ever love me,&mdash;except another bear.
And you know that the love of another bear
was out of the question to one in my advanced
state of refinement. What was I to do? I
could have loved a dear object&mdash;a great many,
I am sure&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;I
do not quite well know <i>what</i> I say at this
exciting moment. But&mdash;let me try to tell you,
that I felt it impossible to live all my life
without some tender acquaintance with the
little god of love, and as I was by this time
long past the season of youth, I was resolved
to let my heart be lost with the first object
that should present herself to my fancy.</p>

<p>But, strange to relate, no sooner had I
made up my mind to fall in love with the first
amiable and lovely person I saw than I ceased
to meet with any such as I often used to see
before. So I began to think the wish had left
me, and I determined to study something very
difficult in order to occupy my mind, and perhaps
cure myself of these lovely fancies. I,
therefore, decided to take a course of studies
under Mr. Professor Abraham Littlepump,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and with that view I first came to this village.
I arrived in the evening as you know, but did
not intend to have made my visit till next
morning, had I not been attracted by the loud
merriment of our young friends here. It has
always happened that Mr. Professor Abraham
Littlepump has been absent when I paid you a
visit; but this does not concern me in regard to
the mathematics. I have seen one here in this
room&mdash;who has put all the mathematics clean
out of my head. And now comes the end of
my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Bear uttered those words everybody
began to look all round the room and then at
each other and then all round the room
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can Mr. Good-Natured Bear mean?&#8221;
said Nancy in a whisper to one of the older
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret dear,&#8221; said little Valentine,
&#8220;your ears are as red as my scarlet-runner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; said Dr. Littlepump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity an unfortunate creature,&#8221; said the
stout gentleman. &#8220;I have at length seen the
object of my devout wishes. Yes, in this very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
room in this house&mdash;have I seen just exactly
what I have been speaking of. You understand
me?&#8221; There was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that I could have had the honour and
happiness of being your brother Abraham!
I would have devoted my mind to far more
beautiful thoughts. Seated in his arm-chair
and thinking about mathematical problems he
never dreamed of the charming object that
was continually before him, sometimes singing
to the children, sometimes teaching them to
read, and to dance, sometimes working with
her delightful needle. Oh, let me change
places with him&mdash;the cold, insensible, stick of
a slate pencil! Now I know what I am saying&mdash;or
rather I do not very well know what
I am saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Bear here began to cry, and several
of the children cried too. But he went
on with his strange speech all the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Mr. Professor Uncle Abraham stay
where he is, with his problems and dumps,
and let me be allowed to remain in his place
and sit in his chair, so that I may enjoy the
happy society of the sweet-voiced Margaret,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
nursery-governess in the amiable family of
Mr. Dr. Littlepump.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he concluded the last sentence the unhappy
gentleman sank back in his chair, and
Gretchen covered her face entirely with both
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only dare to speak of my affection for
this sweet creature. I know I am old for her,
too ugly, besides being a Bear. I know I have
no hope, but what can I do? How can I help
this beating heart? What is to become of
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time all the children had tears in
their eyes. Nancy and little Valentine, however,
got close to Gretchen, holding her fast
on each side, for fear that perhaps poor Mr.
Bear might want to carry her away. Everybody
was silent.</p>

<p>At last Nancy ventured to say in a trembling
voice, &#8220;Perhaps, dear Mr. Bear, you
might find somebody else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that I had eloquence!&#8221; exclaimed the
Bear. &#8220;Oh, that the best words would come
of themselves in the best places, while other
best words were getting themselves ready to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
poured out! Then I should be able to touch
the human heart. But, as it is, all my hopes
are vanity,&mdash;are in fact nothing at all. I must
leave this busy scene and go to some quiet
place where I am not known. I will again
visit the haunts of my childhood and stay
there. Oh! my native woods! Ye silent
nights, ye small bright stars playing bo-peep
through the boughs into hollow caves! I will
go back among you, and in the cool, green
grass will I lay my head. Farewell! Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can nothing be done for you, sir?&#8221; said
Mrs. Littlepump in a soft voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Margaret,&#8221; said Doctor Littlepump,
&#8220;you hear what Mrs. Littlepump asks.
It is for you to make some kind of an answer.
I wish my brother Abraham were here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never love the gentleman in the
rough coat,&#8221; said Margaret, still holding one
hand before her face. &#8220;I do not mind his being
much older than myself, nor do I think
him so very, very ugly&mdash;only, he is a Bear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a devoted Bear!&#8221; declared the stout
gentleman with enthusiasm, &#8220;and I will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
anything else I can, that the dear object may
command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had a dream!&#8221; said Margaret timidly
looking up and waiting. &#8220;I have had a
dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; said Dr. Littlepump sternly.
&#8220;Come, come, I begin to feel uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not feel so!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bear,
clasping his paws together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make haste!&#8221; continued the Doctor, fixing
his eyes upon Margaret. &#8220;Make haste! Let
us hear your dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dreamed,&#8221; said Margaret, trembling,
&#8220;that Mr. Bear must go into that closet, and
be locked in. Then, all the children were to
form a magic circle in the middle of the room,
and move slowly round, hand in hand, nine
times, saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first1">&#8216;Oh, Mr. Bear!</div>
<div class="verse">Cupid hears your fond prayer!</div>
<div class="verse">Remember your mother&#8217;s words,&mdash;never despair!&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>After this, a glass of lemonade and a slice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of cake were to be placed ready for each to
take the moment the door was opened, and
they saw that the charm was complete. I
dreamed this would cause Mr. Bear to be
made happy somehow. And then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; said Dr. Littlepump, &#8220;what
then? I repeat I am beginning to feel very
uncomfortable. I smell a plot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we shall soon see what the dream will
do,&#8221; said Mrs. Littlepump. &#8220;Mr. Bear, will
you run all risks of what may happen, and go
into the closet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do anything, dear Mrs. Littlepump!&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Bear. Saying this, he
ran towards the closet headforemost. The
door was open. The children all peeped in
and looked round cautiously to see if anybody
was there, but it was quite empty. A large
mirror hung on the wall, at the further end.
Mr. Bear stepped in, and waited for what
might happen to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All in the dark!&#8221; said little Valentine,
&#8220;and the door locked!&#8221;</p>

<p>The children now formed a circle in the
middle of the room, and while Margaret was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
pouring out glasses of lemonade, and Lydia
and Dorothea were cutting slices of cake, and
Wallis was cleaning his spectacles, and Dr.
and Mrs. Littlepump were standing silently
holding each other by both hands&mdash;the children
turned in a circle nine times, repeating
the words of the charm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh, Mr. Bear!</div>
<div class="verse">Cupid hears your fond prayer!</div>
<div class="verse">Remember your mother&#8217;s words&mdash;never despair.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>When they had finished Mrs. Littlepump
unlocked the closet door. Everybody was so
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret,&#8221; whispered Mrs. Littlepump,
&#8220;go and tap at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret did so, and then the door slowly
began to open. It stopped opening, and a
voice inside said, &#8220;You must take my hand,
or I cannot come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then a well-formed hand was put forth.
With a face all scarlet with blushes Margaret
gently took it. And then&mdash;who should come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
out of the closet but dear Uncle Abraham!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is dear Uncle Abraham!&#8221; shouted all
the children, &#8220;but where is the Bear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children all ran right into the closet,
scrambling, squeaking, and searching all
about, but finding nothing! Soon they came
crowding, and began to run round Uncle
Abraham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the fascinating rough gentleman?&#8221;
cried everybody in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Here I am!</i>&#8221; exclaimed a soft hoarse
voice, as if from a great distance.</p>

<p>They all looked round and round. Nobody
like Mr. Bear was to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I am become a happy Shadow!</i>&#8221; continued
the voice, &#8220;<i>and I have left my dear friend and
mathematical tutor in my place!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice seemed still as distant as before;
and yet, somehow, it appeared to come from
the closet. Into the closet, therefore, all the
children again rushed pell mell. They were
no sooner in than they suddenly gave a great
shout;&mdash;and then became quite silent as with
some new wonder.</p>

<p>The rest of the party hastened to the closet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The children were all looking in the mirror
which hung at the other end, and in it were
distinctly seen the reflection in miniature of
Mr. Bear, very nicely shaved round the chin,
and dressed as a nobleman in a court dress.
He was dancing a polka on the lawn of a
castle made of clouds, with another Shadow
dressed exactly like Margaret, only still prettier,
while the figure of Cupid sat on the tip-top
of one of the turrets, holding his quiver
like a violin, and playing delightfully upon it
with his bow.</p>

<p>Presently the whole vanished. There was
nothing to be seen in the mirror except the
wondering faces of those who went close up
to it.</p>

<p>Out came all the children, one by one, with
looks of equal pleasure and bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not altogether prepared for this,&#8221;
said Dr. Littlepump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mrs. Littlepump, &#8220;the Land of
Shadows is full of delights of all kinds; and
as to your brother&#8217;s affair of the heart, it is
not the first time that a grave man fell in love
with a merry girl. It was, at least, as natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
in him as in Mr. Bear&mdash;not to speak unkindly
or disrespectfully of our dear departed
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it certainly is the first time,&#8221; said Dr.
Littlepump, &#8220;that a Bear, however good-natured,
was so lucky as to become a Happy
Shadow, such as you describe, and to be able
to bequeath a young bride to his tutor. In
fact, my brain is confused upon several points.
And the more I reflect, the more my head goes
round. Brother! I always used to consider
you a strong-minded man&mdash;but now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will dance at my wedding!&#8221; said
Abraham Littlepump.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Dr. Littlepump. &#8220;God bless
you, brother Abraham. Good-natured Bear,
indeed! Poor gentleman! I do not mean to
say anything at all unkind&mdash;but I <i>do</i> say, bless
my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My good brother,&#8221; said Abraham Littlepump,
&#8220;as for Mr. Bear, we shall ever retain
the tenderest recollections of him. He was
thrown upon an unfeeling world, and was
unhappy. But he is very happy now, somewhere
else. For has he not vanished into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Land of Shadows, there to dance forever on a
green lawn, with the image of his adorations!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rejoice extremely to hear it!&#8221; cried Dr.
Littlepump, catching up his flute; &#8220;and I feel
persuaded that I am at this moment inspired
to play the very same polka which Cupid has
just played to Mr. Bear and his bride!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the children all set up a long hearty
shout of applause; and when they were quite
done Dr. Littlepump applauded himself&mdash;at
which they all began again. Then the children,
still laughing, formed a circle, hand in
hand, round Dr. and Mrs. Littlepump, and
Abraham Littlepump and Margaret, and
danced round and round them. And they sang
the following rhyme, in which the Bear was
lovingly included, just as if he had been present,
because his memory was so dear to them
all. The Doctor accompanied them on his
flute.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">&#8220;Oh, Doctor! Oh, Bear!</div>
<div class="indent">Oh, new-married pair!</div>
<div class="verse">Of good luck and good friends</div>
<div class="indent">Oh, never despair!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Abraham Littlepump now became so overjoyed,
that he was unable to contain himself.
He hugged them all round, and finally catching
the Doctor in his arms, made him get up
behind him pick-a-back. Then Mrs. Littlepump
and Margaret joined hands with the
circle of children, and they all danced round
the two brothers, singing the rhyme again,
while the Doctor flourished his flute in the
air, like the conductor of some great band of
music.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHRISTMAS WISHES</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Louise Chollet</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">King Nutcracker</span> prepared for the Christmas
feast with uncommon splendour, for on
that day Santa Claus had promised his three
sons&mdash;what do you suppose? A pony or a
boat apiece? Of what use to bring such things
to Prince Nutcracker and Prince Buttons,
who were men, while for the little Prince
Pepin, he had everything that he wanted since
he first learned to cry for it! No, Santa Claus
had promised them each a wish! What would
the princes wish? Nobody knew. For though
the Court Journal declared that of course their
wishes would insure the happiness of their
subjects, the Court Journal <i>knew</i> no more of
the matter than you or I; and as all this happened
before we were born, that is just nothing.
Nevertheless, for weeks beforehand, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
entire court was in a state of preparation.
The Duke of the Powder Closet powdered the
comb wigs at such a rate that they were
obliged to station a line of pages from the
Powder closet to the pantry, who passed up
refreshments continually to keep his strength
up. The Queen wore her hair in curl-papers
for a week, and spent the most of
her time in the kitchen where the pies and
plum-pudding were in making; and his Majesty
grumbled that he could not stir without
stumbling over a trumpeter, practising his
bit of the Christmas chorus in a corner. For
himself, the king ordered a new blue-velvet
coat, and sent his crown and sceptre to be
mended and rubbed up at a goldsmith&#8217;s. All
the pink pages had new green slippers. Ten
of these pages were to help Santa Claus out
of his sleigh and ten were to hold the reindeer;
and all the time they were to sing a song
of welcome, and to step all together. So they
practised five hours a day with the Lord High
Fiddlesticks; and the Lord High Fiddle-stick
bawled himself hoarse, while the pages
lost flesh and temper in trying to learn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>What a pity, after all this pains, that Santa
Claus left his reindeer behind him, and, slipping
in just when nobody was looking for him,
stood among them, not with his Christmas
face, but looking sad and surly! &#8220;If you were
my boys,&#8221; said he gruffly, &#8220;catch me giving
you a wish. I would shut you up in an iceberg
first! However, a promise is a promise.
Let us hear what you have to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the courtiers stood on tiptoe, and you
might have heard a pin drop, they were so
anxious to know what the princes wished.</p>

<p>Pepin, though the youngest, being a saucy,
spoiled boy, spoke first. &#8220;A prince should
always have his own way,&#8221; said Pepin.
&#8220;Now there are a great many things that vex
me. Sometimes, when I am flying my kite,
there is no wind. Now I think that a prince
should always be able to fly his kite: if not, I
might as well be any other boy. In the same
way, it rains when I am going to drive, and
the sun sets before I am ready; and my ball
will tumble down when I want it to stay up,
and sometimes it is too warm, and sometimes
it is too cold; in short, there is no end to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
annoyances, and I want to regulate these
things myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Santa Claus looked hard at Pepin to see if
he was quite in earnest. Pepin looked back at
Santa Claus with a serious face. &#8220;Have your
wish while you remain a prince,&#8221; said Santa
Claus.</p>

<p>The courtiers stared, but no one had time
to make any remarks; for Prince Nutcracker,
in a violent hurry lest Buttons should get
ahead of him, wished for the luck-penny.
Now you know whoever has a luck-penny will
make money, more money, much money, and
will never lose any.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is one objection,&#8221; remarked
Santa Claus. &#8220;By continual use, the luck-penny
by and by will look larger to you than
anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is nothing,&#8221; said Nutcracker, slipping
the luck-penny into his pocket.</p>

<p>Prince Buttons, blushing to the tips of his
ears, wished &#8220;to marry the shoemaker&#8217;s sweet
daughter, and that the spirit of Christmas
might live in their house the year round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us your hand!&#8221; cried Santa Claus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
pulling out the holly-sprig from his cap, and
giving it to Buttons, but the King jumped up,
fuming and spluttering: &#8220;You idiot! You
ninny! The daughter of the shoemaker and
the Christmas spirit, indeed. Christmas
fiddlestick and fol-de-rol! Out of my sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>His Royal Highness was in such a rage
that he actually lifted his royal foot to kick
the prince. The Queen fainted; the courtiers
cried, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; Prince Buttons ran away in the
midst of the hubbub; Santa Claus disappeared;
and, to make matters better, the court
suddenly found itself in darkness. It was high
noon, but the sun had popped out of the sky
like a snuffed-out candle. Nobody could find
candles or matches, and if the confusion was
great in the palace, it was worse in the city.
People were left standing in darkness at the
shops and ferries and depots. People who
were eating dinners, and people who were getting
them, and people who had just come out
to see Christmas, were all served alike. Everybody
was in a fright; some screamed one thing
and some another; and all the time there was
nothing the matter, only Prince Pepin, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
was in a hurry to see the arch of Chinese lanterns,
had ordered the sun to set.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Pepin,&#8221; cried the King in a passion,
&#8220;order the sun up again, and if I catch
you doing such a thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Pepin, who was afraid of his father, did not
wait for the rest of the sentence; so, just as
everybody had lighted candles, or turned on
the gas, there was the sun again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; said Pepin, sulkily, &#8220;I am
not having my own way after all,&#8221; and he
went in a wretched humour to play battle-door
and shuttlecock. He made bad strokes, and
the shuttlecock tumbled on the ground.
&#8220;Hateful thing, forever coming down!&#8221; cried
Pepin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It only obeys the law of gravitation, my
dear,&#8221; said the Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish there was no law of gravitation,&#8221;
snapped Pepin.</p>

<p>Whisk! Pepin was flying through the air
as if he had been shot from a gun. Kicking
frantically, he saw the King, the Queen, everything,
coming after him! Something hit him
hard on the nose. He was in a perfect storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of great round apples, flying in all directions!
Bang! bump! on his head, in his mouth, on
his shoulders! How he wished they had
stayed in the market! Pepin dodged and
squalled; the air was full of stones and timbers;
a horse was kicking just over his head;
somebody had him by the hair, and somebody
else by the legs, for, of course, everybody
clutched in all directions to save himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; screamed Pepin amidst the general
uproar of barking, neighing, braying, clucking
and shouting, &#8220;I wish the law of gravitation
was back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once Pepin, the King, the Queen, and
the people, were on their feet. Everything
was in its accustomed place,&mdash;everybody a
little rumpled, but nobody hurt. The King
was disposed to be angry, but the Queen declared
that Pepin was only a little thoughtless,
the courtiers murmured, &#8220;Quite natural,&#8221; and
the Court Journal pronounced the affair the
best joke of the season; but the people looked
very glum over it.</p>

<p>That made no difference to Pepin, who continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
his jokes very much at his ease. Often,
when he was lazy, the sun did not rise until
noon; and people might twist and turn in bed,
or go about their business by candle-light, as
they chose; when, on the contrary, he found
his play amusing, he sometimes kept the sun
in the sky till nine o&#8217;clock at night, while all
the children in the city were crying for sleepiness.
Three nations declared war on King
Nutcracker, because Pepin sometimes ordered
a dead calm for weeks, and sometimes had the
winds blowing from all quarters at once, and
navigation was quite impossible. The doctors
were almost worn out, and the people died on
all sides from constant violent changes of
weather, for, if my young master got heated
in his play, he made nothing of ordering the
thermometer down to sixty degrees. The
farmers were all in despair, for Pepin hardly
allowed a drop of rain to fall; and having a
fancy for skating in summer, he ruined what
harvest there was by a week of ice and snow
in July.</p>

<p>Remonstrance was quite useless, for Pepin
was no longer afraid of his father, since he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
could leave him at any time in total darkness.
So one night there was heard a loud knocking
at the palace gate, and, though the pages and
the guards and the watchmen turned over on
the other side, and tried very hard to go to
sleep again, the knocking grew so loud that
they were obliged to get up and see what was
the matter. There was a mob at the gates;
the people, tired of Pepin&#8217;s jokes, had rebelled.
Some ran one way and some another.
Prince Nutcracker put his luck-penny in his
pocket and walked out of the back door; no
one stayed to look after the King and Queen,
who were running about in nightcap and slippers,
in a terrible fright; and if it had not
been for Buttons, who, on the first alarm, ran
to the palace, from which he had been kicked
out six months before, they would have been
in a sorry case, I think.</p>

<p>On the next day the Court Journal came
out with a new heading. It was called now
the People&#8217;s Journal, and it said that, on the
night before, old Mr. and Mrs. Nutcracker
and their boy Pepin had escaped, nobody
knew how, and nobody cared; and that young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Mr. Nutcracker, the former heir to the
throne, had opened a fine new store on Main
Street.</p>

<p>So, you perceive, there was no longer a royal
family.</p>

<p>As Nutcracker had the luck-penny, of
course he made money in his new store. Every
day, and all day long, he looked straight at the
penny. At first he used to see other things;
but as he took no notice of them, by and by
the penny grew so large that it covered them
all, and then he had no more trouble. He
made money all the year round and he gave
none of it away. None to Pepin, because he
had brought about their misfortunes. None
to Buttons, because he might have wished for
something better, if he liked, than a holly-bush
and the shoemaker&#8217;s daughter. None to
anybody, because why should not people work
and earn money, as he had done, if they
wanted it? And every day he grew more and
more like his penny,&mdash;that is, of less and less
use for anything that was not buying and selling.
For Santa Claus, he had not seen him in
ten years, till one Christmas eve, when hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
a sudden jingling of sleigh-bells, he looked
up and saw Santa Claus just coming down on
the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped my sleigh,&#8221; said Santa Claus,
&#8220;to see if you had anything to send your father
and brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I send them anything?&#8221; answered
Nutcracker, surlily.</p>

<p>Santa Claus put his hands down deep in
his fur pockets, as if he was trying to hold
himself. &#8220;What for! Aren&#8217;t you rich and
they poor? Your own flesh and blood? Confound
it, man! if you have not the instinct of
a son and a brother, you must feel the Christmas
spirit at least once a year in your heart,
urging you to love and kindness towards your
fellow-men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t, then,&#8221; snarled Nutcracker.
&#8220;Men need holidays to rest, I suppose, though
I don&#8217;t; but for Christmas being any better,
or having anything more in it than any other
day, I say, bosh! Give me plenty of money,
and I can buy all the love and kindness I
want! And if other folks want it, let them
work and earn money as I do, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Nutcracker never finished this speech, because&mdash;he
could not. A singular dumb, dry
and hard feeling had taken possession of him.
His legs were gone. At least he could see
them nowhere; so were his arms. Something
wrapped him around. He had a strange
notion that he had grown round, and that&mdash;it
sounds ridiculous&mdash;but Nutcracker was quite
positive that he was in a table drawer among
some coin, and that he was&mdash;a copper penny.</p>

<p>By and by he heard a shrill voice, &#8220;Mr.
Nutcracker, Mr. Nutcracker!&#8221; That was his
wife. Then he heard his children calling,
&#8220;Papa, papa!&#8221; Then a running up and down
stairs. They were searching for him. Then
somebody declared that he had disappeared,
somebody else said that he must be advertised
for, and, taking a handful of money from
the drawer, Nutcracker among the rest, carried
him to a newspaper office, and paid him
in at a window for an advertisement about his
own disappearance. Two minutes after, the
man at the window gave him in change to a
gentleman, who paid him out to a newsboy,
who bought an apple with him of a grocer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
who gave him in change again to a shoemaker,
who dropped him into his soiled and
patched pocket, where Nutcracker found
nothing else but a five-dollar gold-piece.</p>

<p>This shoemaker was Buttons. Was not this
a charming way for two brothers to meet?</p>

<p>The pocket into which Nutcracker dropped
was a very poor pocket,&mdash;soiled and patched,
as I said; but Nutcracker had not been in it
five minutes when he felt&mdash;how shall I tell
you? It is not easy to describe feelings, but
this shoemaker, who walked in the biting
wind with no overcoat and his hands in his
pockets, had warmth and sparkle in his heart
that made Nutcracker feel brighter, though he
could not tell why. There were Christmas
trees on all corners, and Christmas wreaths
piled on the stands, and at every tree and
wreath Buttons warmed more and more.
There were women going home from market,
with a broad grin on their faces, and a drum
or a little bedstead on the top of the cranberries
and turkey and Buttons laughed back
at them as he walked, whistling and looking
around him; and splendid ladies came smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
out of the shops, and Buttons smiled at them;
till between the signs of Christmas and the
pleasant faces he got in such a glow that Nutcracker
would hardly have said that he needed
an overcoat.</p>

<p>All this time Buttons walked very fast and
very straight till he came to a certain shop
with a low door. Outside of this door was a
clothes stand, and on this stand hung an overcoat,
marked &#8220;Only Five Dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buttons stopped. &#8220;Now,&#8221; said he to himself,
&#8220;I need an overcoat. I have got five dollars
in my pocket. Shall I buy this overcoat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Buttons imagined himself in the overcoat.
His coat-tails would not fly out, and
of course he could not put his hands in his
pockets; and if not, where should he put
them? Buttons took another look at the coat.
It was certainly good for five dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Buttons, &#8220;if I buy it they will
have no Christmas dinner, and Ma Nutcracker
has set her heart on chicken and pudding.
My little wife will never know the difference
between Christmas and any other day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Poor Pepin, in his bed, will never know
any difference. I shall come home in my
brutal overcoat and that will be all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he began checking off on his fingers
like this: &#8220;A dressing-gown for father, a
shawl for mother, a new gown for the little
wife, goodies for the children, a box of paints
for Pepin, and the dinner.&#8221; Then he gave a
little sigh, and, putting his hands again in his
pockets, walked away as fast as he came. Do
you suppose that he bought all these things
with the five-dollar gold-piece? Nutcracker
could not see, of course, but he thought not,
for how could he?</p>

<p>Buttons lived upstairs, in a mean little
house in a dirty street. His rooms were small,
and they were crowded. There were old Mr.
and Mrs. Nutcracker, who never forgot that
they had been king and queen, and that Buttons&#8217;
wife was a shoemaker&#8217;s daughter, and
never remembered that Buttons had returned
their cruelty with kindness, and I think were
not very nice people to live with. There was
Pepin, who had been hurt, poor boy! in escaping
from the palace, and who had never risen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
since from his bed. There was Buttons&#8217;
pleasant-faced wife; there were three fat children;
there was the holly-bush, which had
grown into a great tree; and there was&mdash;Nutcracker
did not know what&mdash;but something,
he was quite sure, for which he had been
searching all his life.</p>

<p>The three fat children seized upon Buttons;
one by each hand and one by his coat-tails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Buttons, pretending to groan.
&#8220;I am so tired. Let the best child look outside
of the door and see what he finds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The best child opened the door cautiously,
half afraid, and set up a shout. &#8220;Ma, come
quick! here&#8217;s a chicken, and cranberries, and
a paper,&mdash;it&#8217;s raisins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Raisins!&#8221; screamed the other children.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chicken!&#8221; cried old Mrs. Nutcracker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas wreaths!&#8221; exclaimed his wife,
peeping out into the little dark hall. &#8220;Why,
surely, you never&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Made them? Yes, I did,&#8221; said Buttons,
his eyes dancing. &#8220;In the woods. The cedars
gave me boughs for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas wreaths!&#8221; repeated Pepin from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
his bed. &#8220;Give me one,&#8221; and, seizing it in his
thin fingers, &#8220;Ah! how nice it smells,&mdash;like
the woods!&#8221; he said, laying his pale cheek on
it. &#8220;I wish I could see a tree once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buttons jumped up and ran downstairs
very fast, and they heard him coming back
dragging something after him, bump, bump!
The something rustled and cracked and filled
the room with a strong, spicy scent of the
woods. Buttons lifted it so that it stood just
in front of Pepin&#8217;s bed. It was a spruce-tree.
Its thick, strong branches spread out wide.
Its top brushed the ceiling. Birds had built
nests in its branches, mosses had lived about
its roots. It knew all the secrets of the woods
and the sky and the rains, and it told you about
them, as well as it could, whenever you stirred
its branches. The little wife hung the wreaths
all about the room,&mdash;one on every nail, one
over each window, one over Pepin, one each
on the backs of grandpa&#8217;s and grandma&#8217;s
chairs. It was getting dark, and the firelight
came out and danced on the ceiling and on the
white cover of the little table. Pepin lay
looking at the tree. The children chattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
like little birds; even Grandpa and Grandma
Nutcracker were smiling. The room was like
a spicy cosy little nest. What was it, Nutcracker
wondered more and more, here in
these people&#8217;s faces for which he had laboured
all his life?</p>

<p>Suddenly Pepin cried out, &#8220;O, there is
something here hanging on a branch of the
tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; answered Buttons. &#8220;Then
you had better take it down, Pepin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pepin took it down. &#8220;Why, it is for me,&#8221;
he said, looking at the name on the wrapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you had better open it,&#8221; answered
Buttons in just the same tone as before.</p>

<p>Pepin untied the string, but his hands shook.
&#8220;It is square,&#8221; he said, feeling it. He took off
one wrapper. &#8220;It is hard,&#8221; he said again,
trembling all over. He took off the second
wrapper, and it nearly dropped from his
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;A box of paints!&#8221; screamed the children,
dancing around.</p>

<p>Pepin tried to speak, but he could not get
out a word. He kissed the box, he laughed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
but you could see he was near crying. The
little wife&#8217;s eyes were full of tears also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! come!&#8221; said Buttons. &#8220;Do people
cry over Christmas gifts?&#8221; There were no
tears in his eyes. He was ready to dance,
though now he would have no overcoat. As
for Nutcracker, he had a curious tingling sensation
all over him, though he was only a copper
penny; and, happening to look towards
the hearth, he saw Santa Claus. The old fellow
had tied up his reindeer and slipped down
the chimney, and was winking hard, and wiping
his eyes, while pretending to blow his
nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it! I have got it, and know what
it is!&#8221; cried Nutcracker, at the top of his
lungs. &#8220;The Christmas spirit lives here all the
year round, and these people love one another,
and are happy. That is what I never had at
home&mdash;happiness; that is what my money
could not buy. That is why I was every day
trying to make more money&mdash;always hoping
to make money enough to buy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Should you not think that Buttons would
have been very much frightened to hear such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
a voice coming out of his pocket? No doubt
he would, only, in some mysterious way, Nutcracker
found himself on his legs again, and
he was walking as fast as he could with a
pocketful of money, to buy a monstrous turkey,
and the best overcoat in the city, and
boots and a hat to match, and a new gown,
and a dressing-gown, and a shawl and a set
of paints, and a great bouquet, and a basket of
toys, and candies&mdash;for whom? Why, for
Buttons, and Grandpa and Grandma Nutcracker,
and the pleasant little wife, and
Pepin, and the children, of course!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MAN OF SNOW</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Harriet Myrtle</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was a little girl we lived entirely
in the country for several years, and one winter
there was a great fall of snow. The snow
covered the roof of the house, the roofs of the
stable and cow shed, and the branches of
every tree were so thickly covered with the
beautiful white snow that sometimes in the
morning, when I looked out of the window,
I could, at first, have fancied the trees were
all apple and pear trees full of blossoms.
You may, therefore, believe that the snow lay
very deep in the fields.</p>

<p>We had three fields; one was adjoining our
kitchen; and there was often a cow, or horse,
or pony allowed to walk in it when the grass
was good. This field sloped down into a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
which was parted off by a gate; and then
by a pathway along the side of a high hedge,
we came to a stile, and on the other side of
the stile was our largest field. No cattle were
allowed to enter this field, as the grass was
kept for hay-making. Here, then, the deep
snow lay all broad and white and soft, without
the marks of a single footstep all over the
whole bright expanse, where all was whiteness
and silence.</p>

<p>Now there lived in a pretty lane very near
us an old parish clerk named Downes. He
lived in his cottage with his little granddaughter,
and a blackbird. He was a tall,
thin old man with straight white hair. His
name was Godfred, but we always called him
Gaffer Downes.</p>

<p>One morning during this great snow time
Mr. Gaffer Downes came to my father and
asked permission to make something curious
in his large field. He explained what it was
and had leave given him directly, for everybody
was fond of Gaffer Downes. He had
been parish clerk in our village for nearly
forty years.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Away went Mr. Downes to get assistants for
what he wished to do, and he soon found two
who were willing to help him. One was the
coachman of Squire Turner&#8217;s family, who
were neighbors and friends of ours; and the
other was the parish sexton. Gaffer brought
his spade with him; and the three went off
together through the snow.</p>

<p>They took their way down into our great
field, and there they each made a great snow
ball. Following the directions of Gaffer
Downes, these snow balls were rolled along
until they collected more and more snow upon
their sides all round, and, of course, began to
get very large. Each man&#8217;s snow ball was
soon as large as his head. They went rolling
on, and soon each of the snow balls was as
large as two heads; then as large as a cow&#8217;s
head; then as large as a very great cow&#8217;s head;
and then each man was obliged to stop, as he
could roll his snow ball along no more, it was
so large and heavy. Mr. Downes then told
the coachman and the sexton to leave their
snow balls and come and help him to roll his.
So all three pushed away, and rolled it nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
all round the great field, by which time it was
as large as the head of an elephant.</p>

<p>They stopped to rest and take breath. Mr.
Downes now informed them that he wished
this large ball to be rolled to the middle of
the field, and to remain there while they rolled
the others to the same size, and then brought
them to the same spot. They were just beginning
their work again when they heard a
loud, merry laugh at the other side of the
hedge, and whom should they see looking over
and showing his white teeth and making a
funny face at them but George Poole, the
black footman at Squire Turner&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; said George, &#8220;Aha, Massa Down,
me see you! how you do, Massa Gaffer Down?
and how do you do? Is your pretty granddaughter
at home? and how you do, you
blackbird, Massa Down? aha! very fond of
blackybird; he just my colour. How you do,
you cold finger, Massa Gaffer Down&mdash;and
Massa Sexton, and coachy man, too, with cold
fingers, all so red, like scraped carrots?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George Poole,&#8221; said Mr. Downes with a
serious look, &#8220;George Poole, you interrupt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Come and assist us, or return home to your
fire in a quiet and proper manner, I beg of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me go home to proper fire,&#8221; answered
George, &#8220;but what you make there with great
snow ball, Massa Down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not intend to let anyone know at
present,&#8221; answered Mr. Downes. &#8220;Good day,
George,&#8221; and as he said this he made a sign
to the coachman and sexton, and they continued
their work of rolling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me come and see him when him finished,&#8221;
said George. &#8220;Good day, Massa Down,&#8221; and
as he said this the laughing black face of
George Poole disappeared from the top of the
hedge.</p>

<p>This work of rolling continued all the
morning, and, as they found they had nothing
else to do, they worked at it all the afternoon,
also. By this time they had made seven balls
of snow, each as large as the head of an elephant,
and had rolled them all into the very
middle of the field. But to do this they had
been obliged to ask for the help of two men
from our house. This my father readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
gave; indeed, I believe he himself helped at
the last rolling of each ball, as they were so
very heavy and moved so slowly. Mr. Downes
then took the spade and patted every ball with
the flat part of it, in order to make them even
and hard, and so left them for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning while we were at breakfast
Gaffer Downes passed by the window,
with a spade over his shoulder, followed by
the sexton and coachman each with a spade
over his shoulder, and after them came the
beadle, the church bell ringer, and the young
man who blew the bellows for the organ.</p>

<p>They all followed Mr. Downes into the
large field.</p>

<p>Up we all jumped from the breakfast table
and hurried on our things; papa, mamma and
I, and Ellen Turner, who had heard of something
that was to be done in our field, and
had come over to breakfast with us to see.
Away we all went, mamma carrying me where
the snow was too deep, and papa carrying
Ellen.</p>

<p>When we came into the large field, there we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
saw them all busy indeed, working under the
directions of Gaffer Downes, who was not
working himself now, but standing still in the
attitude of an artist, giving orders to his
pupils. They soon made a sort of flat bank of
snow, about a foot and a half high, and patted
it down very hard with their spades. The
pupils, that is to say, the coachman and sexton
and bell ringer and beadle, and the young
man who blew the bellows for the organ, then
rolled three of the great balls of snow up on
this bank, close to one another, so as to form a
sort of circle, but leaving a hollow place in
the middle of the form of a triangle, which
the beadle remarked was very much the figure
of the coachman&#8217;s Sunday hat. Mr. Downes
now came with his spade, and made this three-cornered
hollow larger, in fact, large enough
for a man to stand in very easily. He then
desired the coachman and sexton to assist him
with their spades in making the tops of these
three balls quite flat. When this was done
he directed them to make three more of the
balls flat at top and bottom; this also being
done, he called all his party together and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
them to lift these three balls, one at a time,
and carefully place them upon the top of
those three that were already placed, as I have
told you. So the pupils did as they were
directed and Mr. Downes made three notches,
like steps, in the side of two of the balls, and
up them he slowly walked with his spade, and
again made the three-cornered hole in the
middle of the three top snow balls, as large
as he had made it in those at the bottom. We
all thought he was going to get into it, but
he did not. He only looked in. He now
came down with a very important look, and
went up to the one large ball of snow, which
still lay there in its round shape. This he
trimmed and patted all about into the form
he wished, and then all the pupils were
called to carry it and lift it by degrees and
to place at the very top where it was intended
to be made the head of the Man of Snow. It
was a great job to get the head safely up, for
it was very heavy. However, after much
time and many narrow escapes of the head,
and all the pupils tumbling down together,
they did manage to get it to the top, just over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the hole which it covered up and its own
weight kept it there safely.</p>

<p>It was now time to go to dinner. We all
went but we finished as soon as we could and
returned to the large field. Gaffer Downes,
the coachman, and sexton moved round and
round with their spades, cutting and shoving
or patting up the snow to make the figure of
a man. And as there were several hollow
places where you could look into the inside,
they filled them up with hard lumps of snow;
all except one hole, which Mr. Downes said
he wished left open to let the air in, though,
on second thought, he said he would cover it
over himself, and so he did, but very lightly.
They made a few trenches and ridges down
the middle and at the sides of the Man, and
this they called his legs and arms, at which
we all laughed. Lastly, Mr. Downes went
climbing up the sides with his spade and went
to work at the head. What he tried to do was
to make a face to it, but it was very difficult.
He cut out the nose and chin, very large and
broad; but some unlucky cut just as he was
finishing made them fall off. He then asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the beadle to bring him two short sticks from
the hedge; this being done, he stuck them into
the face and covered them over with handfuls
of snow, which he pressed and patted into
the shape of a nose and chin. But when he
had finished the weight of the snow made the
sticks come out and down they fell. He went
on trying again and again, and we all looked
on and hoped he would succeed, though we
laughed very much also for the nose fell off
six times and the chin four. At last, however,
with a sudden thought, which could only have
occurred to one who had quite a genius for
making a Man of Snow, Mr. Downes stuck
the two short sticks in not pointing downwards
or straight out, but pointing rather upwards,
so that the weight of the nose and chin were
supported upon the face and they held fast.
And a very strange face it was!</p>

<p>Two things were still to be done. Mr.
Downes drew from his coat pocket a couple
of large round stones of a blue-grey color, and
these he fixed in the face for eyes; and over
the head, at each side, he stuck a number of
small hedge twigs and a wreath from a thorny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
wild rose-tree, for hair. If more snow should
fall he assured us the hair would look quite
beautiful. Down came Mr. Gaffer Downes,
looking so seriously and modestly upon the
snow clumps on his shoes, while we all praised
his work and told him how much we liked his
Man of Snow.</p>

<p>It was now evening. We all went back
through the fields and when we arrived at the
house my papa sent out a quantity of hot ale,
with sugar and toast in it, for the pupils, and
we made Mr. Downes come in to tea with us
though he wanted to go home. He said his
little granddaughter and the blackbird would
think he was lost in the snow.</p>

<p>There did happen to be a slight fall of snow
again in the night and we all went down to
the large field next morning after breakfast
to see what change it had made in the appearance
of the great Man. And a fine change,
indeed, it had made. He looked much larger
and rounder and whiter and colder and
seemed more &#8220;at home&#8221; in the great white
field. And he had a wonderful head of hair!</p>

<p>The very same evening as we were all sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
round the fire, about an hour before supper
time, Mr. Downes came to our house and
sent in word that he had something very important
to say. Mamma said, &#8220;Pray tell Mr.
Downes to come directly.&#8221; In came Gaffer
Downes, looking rather paler than usual, and
with his face looking longer than usual, and
his white hair looking straighter than usual,
and his chin sticking out with some frost upon
it. He remained standing in the middle of
the room without saying a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Mr. Downes?&#8221; asked
papa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Mr. Downes, without moving
from the place where he stood, &#8220;something
has happened!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; said papa, rising
from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;An event!&#8221; said Mr. Downes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What event?&#8221; said mamma, rising from
her chair, &#8220;and where has it happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the large field,&#8221; answered Mr. Gaffer
Downes. &#8220;An event has happened to the
Snow Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this we all ran up to Gaffer Downes, exclaiming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
&#8220;What has happened to him, tell us
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Snow Man,&#8221; said Mr. Downes in a
low voice, &#8220;The Snow Man talks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talks?&#8221; cried we all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the Man speaks. He was
addressing the field in a long speech when I
passed on the other side of the hedge. It is a
fine moonlight night. You can all come and
hear him yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we will!&#8221; exclaimed my papa. &#8220;We
will all go directly.&#8221;</p>

<p>So mamma called for bonnets and shawls
and handkerchiefs and cloaks and muffs, and
tippets and gloves and fur boots and all sorts
of things for there were several young ladies
staying on a visit with us. And outside the
door we found Squire Turner&#8217;s coachman
with the sexton and the beadle and bell ringer
and the young man who blew the bellows for
the organ; in fact, all Gaffer Downes&#8217; pupils,
waiting to go with us into the large field.</p>

<p>Off we all set, Mr. Downes leading the way.
At the end of the first field he made us all
stop to listen. He asked us if any of us could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
hear the Man of Snow speaking. We all
listened and at last said, &#8220;No!&#8221; He then told
us to follow him slowly along the hedge of the
second field listening all the way. We heard
nothing, and again Mr. Downes stopped us at
the stile leading into the great field. Very
attentively we listened, but all was as silent as
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Downes now told us we had better wait
a little and let him go first, and as soon as the
Man of Snow spoke he would return and tell
us to come softly. So over the stile got Mr.
Downes and we soon lost sight of him as he
went creeping round closely by the hedge.
Well, we waited and waited but Mr. Downes
did not return. We listened but we could
hear nothing. Still we waited but at last papa
got out of patience and said, &#8220;What can have
become of Mr. Downes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said mamma, &#8220;nothing has happened
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am determined to go and see after him,&#8221;
said papa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us all go together,&#8221; said mamma.
&#8220;Let us all go together, straight up towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the Man of Snow, and ask for Mr. Downes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was agreed upon and we all got over the
stile and went crowding together along the
field, nobody liking to go first, but all keeping
close, like sheep when they do not know what
to do for the best.</p>

<p>At last we came near the great Man of
Snow. Papa and the young man who blew
the bellows for the organ stood in front, and
next to them came the sexton, and then
mamma, with all us girls climbing close
around her, wrapped up in our cloaks, with
only our eyes and noses to be seen; and behind
us stood the rest of the pupils&mdash;and behind
all, at some distance, stood the beadle. Well,
there we all stood in silence, in the great, silent
snow field, looking at the great silent Man of
Snow with the moon shining upon his head!</p>

<p>The young man who blew the bellows for
the organ was the first who spoke; and he
said in a very respectful voice, &#8220;I ask your
pardon, sir; but could you be so kind as to
tell us what has become of Mr. Downes?&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer was returned. Everything was
as silent as before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>The sexton next spoke; and in a very humble
tone he said, &#8220;May it please your
Majesty! we have lost the clerk of the
parish!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again we all remained in the same suspense
and silence. The moon now went partly behind
a cloud so that only a little pale light
came across one side of the head and shoulders
of the Man of Snow. At last papa was
obliged to speak, and he said, &#8220;Oh, Man of
Snow, we came not to disturb thy tranquillity,
but if thy gracious whiteness hath once already
spoken to these fields, permit us also
to hear thy silent voice!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was again a pause and then, would
you believe it?&mdash;you hardly can&mdash;would you
believe it, the Man of Snow answered! He
did, indeed. In a very slow and solemn voice
he said, &#8220;Peace be upon ye all&mdash;and the silent
thoughtfulness of these white fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may suppose how fearful and astonished
and quiet we all stood at hearing these
words. Presently, however, my papa took
courage, and again addressed the Man of
Snow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;Who art thou&mdash;and whence comest thou,
oh, most serene Highness of the frost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a spirit of Winter!&#8221; answered the
Man of Snow, in the same solemn tone.
&#8220;Once in Lapland I was one of the most renowned
giants. There my image is built up
with white stone, and because this likeness of
me has been made, therefore, on the wings of
the wind hath my spirit crossed the bleak seas
to dwell for a little time in this body of snow.
But now depart! I would be alone!&mdash;retire!
To-morrow, at moon-rise, ye may come
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not dare to disobey this command
to depart, you may be sure; so we all
went homewards, too full of thoughts to
speak.</p>

<p>Just as we had reached the stile one of the
young ladies cried out, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s that under
the hedge!&#8221; We all looked, and there we saw
the head of a man rising out of the dry ditch
by the side of the hedge! Who do you think
it was? It was the poor beadle. He had been
so frightened when the Man of Snow spoke
that he had run back, but, being unable to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
over the stile, in his confusion, he got into the
dry ditch and sat there upon the dead leaves
and snow, with his chin just level with the
top of the bank. However, the pupils soon
lifted him out and comforted him and took
him home. They also went to the cottage of
Gaffer Downes to know if he had returned
safely. But he had not returned.</p>

<p>Before we went to supper, however, we sent
to the cottage, as we were getting very anxious;
and his granddaughter answered from
the window that her dear grandfather had returned
and had a basin of warm broth and
was now in bed.</p>

<p>We could hardly eat our supper, any of us,
for talking of the Man of Snow and what he
had said about having been once upon a time
a Lapland giant! For my part I could not
sleep for thinking of it, and all the young
ladies said the same thing the next morning
at breakfast.</p>

<p>You may be sure we were all very anxious
for the evening to come when we were again
to go and hear what the Man of Snow had
to say. He told us, you recollect, to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
again at moon-rise; and the moon, papa said,
would rise about seven o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>We had a dinner party at our house and
nearly all the time we talked of little else except
the Man of Snow or rather what he had
done when he was a giant in Lapland; and
we thought that, perhaps, he might tell us the
history of his life. We determined every one
of us to go all together down to the great field
when the moon rose.</p>

<p>As the time approached we became so anxious
that we got ready too soon, and then,
as we were all ready, we thought we might
just as well go and wait there till the white
giant chose to speak. So off we all set, and
went very merrily, and yet not without some
little fears, down toward the large field.</p>

<p>But when we had all got over the stile who
should come running after us but Mr.
Downes. He was quite out of breath, but as
soon as he could speak he said, &#8220;Indeed, you
are too soon. It&#8217;s too soon by half an hour.
You had much better get over the stile again
and go into the other field a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this made some of us laugh, for, do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
you know, we now began to suspect that it was
Mr. Downes himself who had spoken for the
Man of Snow.</p>

<p>We thought perhaps he had got behind
somewhere, or perhaps into the side of the
great figure and thus spoken for him. But
now, as we had come too soon he had no time
to get ready. We were sorry for poor Gaffer
Downes, yet still we could not help laughing
at the scrape he was in. He went on assuring
us the Man of Snow would not speak at
all as we had come before the time he ordered.
But this made us laugh the more, as we were
now almost sure how it had been continued.
Meantime, we had slowly advanced toward
the Man of Snow, poor Mr. Downes telling
us all the time that the Man would be sure
not to utter a word as we had disobeyed his
directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;But see,&#8221; said papa, &#8220;the moon is now
rising!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! &#8217;tis no matter now,&#8221; answered Mr.
Downes in a melancholy tone. &#8220;The Man of
Snow will not speak a single word.&#8221; Mr.
Downes had scarcely said this when a voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
from the Man of Snow called out in a loud
tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;How you do, Massa Down&mdash;how you lilly
granddaughter do&mdash;and how you do you black
bird, Massa Gaffer Downes?&#8221;</p>

<p>All burst into laughter except Mr. Downes,
who walked backwards and forwards once or
twice saying, &#8220;Dear me, how very vexatious!&#8221;</p>

<p>Papa and mamma now both went up to Mr.
Downes and told him they saw how vexed he
was at the change that had somehow or other
taken place in the voice of the Man of Snow,
because the spirit of the Lapland Giant had
certainly flown away and quite a different one
had gotten into its place. However, they
begged him not to take it to heart, but to go
and speak to the Man of Snow, and ask him
to explain a little.</p>

<p>Mr. Downes thought for a minute, and then
seeming to make up his mind to it, walked a
few paces nearer to the Man of Snow, and
this curious dialogue took place between
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;Who art thou, oh, rude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
familiar voice, who has usurped the place of
the frosty Spirit of last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;Me the King of Lapland!
speaky more respectful to him Snow-ball
Majesty, Massa Down!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;No Majesty of Snow hast
thou, nor art thou Lapland&#8217;s king, nor ever
wert, nor shalt be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;Why you say so you Massa
Gaffer man! Me come from own country
Lapland late last night after supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;What, then, for supper did
the king of Lapland eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;Berry good supper to be
sure&mdash;great supper in great big palace surrounded
with orange trees and plantain and
banana tree. Me have curried chicken plenty
and hot rice with treacle, and a pineapple,
and watermelon from own garden close by;
and then me have chocolate, berry sweet.
What you t&#8217;ink now, Massa Downes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;I think the King of Lapland
dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;What he dream of then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;He dreams that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
supper in some West Indian isle; for in Lapland
no oranges, no pinies, no watermelons
grow, no plantains, no banana.&#8221;</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;Me never say they did
grow there.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Man of Snow said this we all
of us together cried out, &#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; meaning
what a story he was telling.</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;Me never mean to say so.
Me have great big hothouse, all glass, where
fruit grow; and other t&#8217;ing me have brought
over in fine large ship. Me very rich king;
hab everything me wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;Rich, dost thou say, in
money or in land?&#8221;</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;In money, to be sure. Me
have large chest full of gold&mdash;Lapland gold
and guineas, too&mdash;my friend and brother, the
King of England, send me; and me have
plenty land, too. Large fields of rice&mdash;no, not
rice; rice not grow in Lapland&mdash;me know dat
very well. Me mean to say, large plantation
of sugar cane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Downes: &#8220;Nor doth the sugar cane in
Lapland grow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Man of Snow: &#8220;Me know that very well&mdash;me
just going to say so. But me try to make
him grow; me try to bring new tings into my
country; me try to get horses and oxen, and
sheep, and deer, and dogs, and many bullfrogs,
and rattlesnakes. Me want to change scorpions
and mosquitoes into butterflies and lady-birds.
Me want to have all manner of fine house for
fine birds&mdash;parrots and macaws, with green
wings and scarlet tails and blue breasts, and
topknots; and peacocks and birds of paradise
and a great pond of gold and silver fishes.
And me mean to build great big bamboo house
for all these, twice as high as my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Man of Snow said this, we all saw
his head shake a little, as if he was in a great
fuss with what he was thinking about doing;
and we even thought we saw the upper part
of the figure shake a little, and some pieces
of snow began to crumble and fall. But he
went on speaking again.</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;And me mean to have elephants
and rhinoceroses and apes with long
arms and blue noses. And me mean to build
a house for elephants very large and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
strong; so that when we catch wild elephant,
he no can get out. He try, and try&mdash;but he
can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here we all saw the Man of Snow shake
again.</p>

<p>Man of Snow: &#8220;Makey house all sides very
strong bamboo. See him angry-trunk poke
through the bars of cage&mdash;but all too fast and
strong. He no can get out. Then he make
trumpet noise with trunk, and him lilly cunning
eye look so very angry; and then he run
him head right against the front of cage to try
and push him down! but it is all too strong,
and he can&#8217;t&mdash;yet he push! and push!&mdash;and
trumpet with trunk&mdash;and push! and, oh,
Massa Down!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Man of Snow uttered these words
off rolled his head and broke into twenty
pieces!&mdash;and the next instant the whole figure
cracked, and opened in the middle and fell to
pieces&mdash;and out rolled George Poole upon the
snow, crying out: &#8220;Oh, Massa Down, why you
no build him stronger?&#8221;</p>

<p>You may suppose how we all laughed.
One of the young ladies almost went into a fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of laughing and most of us laughed till we had
a pain at both sides of the face, and yet we
were unable to stop.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Downes laughed; not at first,
though; at first he made a very long face, then
he began, &#8220;te! he! he!&#8221;&mdash;and &#8220;he! he! he!&#8221; till
at last he went into &#8220;ha! ha! ha! Oh, dear
me!&#8221;&mdash;and was obliged to sit down upon the
snow and wipe his forehead to recover himself.</p>

<p>We all returned to the house very merrily
laughing all the way. We brought the King
of Lapland with us, for George had always
been a favourite in the village. So we told the
cook to give his Majesty a large basin of rice,
milk, and sugar, and mamma sent him afterwards
a large slice of plum cake, and a tumbler
with some sugar and lemons. Papa
requested Mr. Downes to come in to supper
with us, but he said that he really must
go home, as his granddaughter and the blackbird
would think something had happened to
him. Papa, however, would take no denial,
so we made Mr. Downes come in, and then we
sent a man for his granddaughter with a message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
that she was to bring the blackbird with
her.</p>

<p>So, in a few minutes afterwards, in came a
pretty little girl of ten years of age, with blue
eyes and flaxen hair, and a complexion like a
rose, bringing in her hand a large milk-white
wicker cage with the blackbird sitting in the
middle. He was as black as coal with a yellow
bill, and oh! such a bright, black eye. He
sat on his perch with his head bent on one side
a little, then he jumped down to the bottom of
the cage, and, poking his head between the
bars, gave a look all round. He then hopped
back into the middle of the cage, bowed very
low and very quickly several times, and then
hopped upon his perch with his tail toward us,
but instantly whisked round, as if he was
afraid somebody was going to touch his tail.
Then he began to sing. He sang nearly all
supper time, and flapped his black wings while
we all stood up and drank the health of Mr.
Gaffer Downes, the artist who had made the
Man of Snow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edward Abbott Parry</span></p>

<p class="center">[Used by permission of the author.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a black beetle
named Butterwops. He was very old, very
wise, and had seen a great deal of the world.
He had lived in a number of different houses,
and was said to know more about the various
qualities of sugar than a blue-bottle, and to
understand the ways of men better than a
cricket. Therefore, it is not to be wondered
at that he became the leader of a small army
of beetles, who called him &#8220;The General.&#8221;
He had a thick hoarse laugh, and could tell
many tales, both fierce and merry, of battles
he had fought against earwigs, cockroaches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
and caterpillars. But for some time his laugh
had not been heard, and he had been sad and
melancholy, for his army were dying by the
thousands, and if things went on in the way
they were going, there would soon be not a
single beetle left to listen to the tales of &#8220;The
General.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kitchen he lived in had plenty to eat
in it, and was warm and comfortable, with
lots of cracks in the walls and ceiling to live
in during the day; but lately the master of
the house had taken to spreading yellow powder
over the floor and the young beetles would
eat it, and it disagreed with them and
they died. This yellow powder, so Butterwops
told me, smelled deliciously of sugar
and cheese and all the young beetles, being
greedy, ate it up wherever they could find
it. What happened to them after they tasted
it was this: as soon as they had three mouthfuls,
they felt a bad pain underneath their
shell, turned over on their backs, kicked a
little and died, and in the morning the cook
swept them up and threw them into the garden.
No wonder that Butterwops felt sad.
He himself never tasted anything unless he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
had seen another beetle try it first and had
watched him walk about for quite five minutes.
That is how he came to live to be old
and became general; but he told nobody about
that, keeping it a secret.</p>

<p>Butterwops had a great-grandson called little
Jimmy. He was very lively and adventurous,
and was always trotting across the floor
in the daytime to frighten the cook; so it is
a wonder he had lived as long as he had. He
did not eat the yellow powder, for he was
an obedient little beetle, and always did what
Butterwops told him to do. As he ran about
so much in the daytime he was generally the
first to hear the news, and one day, about this
time, he came to Butterwops and told him
that the house on the other side of the street
was rented, and he had seen some people moving
into it while he was sitting on the window-sill
in the gloaming on Thursday evening,
which was the cook&#8217;s night out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy that!&#8221; said Butterwops. &#8220;Why I
used to live in that house when I was a tiny
little beetle just your size. It&#8217;s a grand old
house. Not a skirting board within half an
inch of the floor, cracks in all the walls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
holes in the plaster. I wonder what sort of
people are living in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Newly married people,&#8221; said little Jimmy,
&#8220;whatever that may mean. I heard the
cook say so, and the policeman told her about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Butterwops, rubbing his hind
legs together thoughtfully; &#8220;newly married
people. They will do for us. They will have
lots of sugar and leave it about, and then they
will get some children to live with them, and
the children won&#8217;t eat fat and will make
crumbs all over the floors; there will be lots
to eat. We shall move.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night &#8220;The General&#8221; called all the
beetles round him after the cook had rolled
the rug up and had gone to bed, and, sitting
on the heel of one of the master&#8217;s boots which
were drying on the fender, explained to all
the beetles that they must move across the
road. &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there is a newly married
couple over the way. Now this kind
of human being eats little else than sugar,
and knows nothing of the ways of the world
or the habits of the beetle. Their hearts are
full of kindliness, and believing others to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
as good as they are, they leave the best food
in the easiest places. So happy are they together,
that they would not interfere with the
happiness of others, even though they are
black and wear shells. With them we may
live for many years in health and comfort,
whereas, here we die by tens and twenties
every night. Arise, therefore, and follow me
carefully and quickly. But when you are on
the pavements in the road listen carefully for
the tread of the policeman. If he comes
among us while we are on the pavements he
will kill many of us, for policemen have bigger
feet than any other kind of men; only,
luckily, they wear squeaky boots so that they
may be heard coming a long way off. Now
follow me and remember what I have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>So speaking he crawled off the boot, down
across the floor, under the scullery door, along
the garden walk, across the pavements, in at
the opposite gateway, round to the back door
of the other house; and in half an hour Butterwops,
little Jimmy, and two hundred and
forty-nine of the beetles were safe in their
new house, having crossed the road with the
loss of only three beetles. Two tumbled down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a drain, and a third lost his way in trying to
make a short cut across a flower bed.</p>

<p>They all set to work to get comfortable in
their new quarters, and Butterwops, who liked
to be near the fire, found a crack in the wall
on top of the oven where they dried the wood.
From this place of safety, he could come out
and walk about among the warm wood and
enjoy the heat, and yet run away on the first
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is capital,&#8221; he said, as he sat warming
himself and watching twenty-five beetles
climbing into the sugar basin at once; &#8220;this
is peace and quiet, and here we shall be very
happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the master of the old house they had
lived in, he was very happy too, and wrote
and told the man from whom he had bought
the yellow powder: &#8220;Your powder has killed
all the beetles in my house.&#8221; And the man
who sold the powder printed that in all the
newspapers, and other people bought it; but
it did not kill all their beetles, and that made
them angry. Now if they read this story they
will know how it really happened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Although, as I have said, the house itself
was very old, and suitable for beetles in every
respect, yet all the things in the house were
new, and perhaps the newest thing of all was
the young servant, who seemed rather jealous
of the other new things and often broke them.
At present they had no cat, and as there was
no one else to blame, the new mistress scolded
the new servant, and then they both cried; especially
if it happened, as it often did, that
what was broken was a wedding present.
However, the mistress was far too happy to be
angry for long, and too proud of all the beautiful
pots and pans in the kitchen, which she
loved better than any of the lovely furniture
in the drawing-room, to keep away from them
for many hours. Besides, the young servant
did not know much about anything, and the
mistress used to help her to cook, and especially
to get the master&#8217;s tea ready when he
came home. Indeed, in spite of the breakages,
they were all very happy. The mistress
used to go about the house singing brightly
and cheerfully; while the young servant had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
four lumps of sugar in her tea and a large
slice of cake with it every night, so that she
was quite happy, although singing was out
of the question. As for the master, you had
only to see him running up the house steps to
see how glad he was to get home again after
his day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>And dear old Butterwops! Why, it did his
kind heart good to see so much happiness.
The food was left about in easy places, and
the larder door was always wide open so that
you did not have to scrape your shell getting
underneath it. It was a grand place for beetles,
and Butterwops told them that if they
kept quiet during the day and came out only
at night, things would go well with them. Indeed,
I have no doubt it would have been as
he said, if they had only obeyed his instructions;
but beetles, like children, sometimes
forget to do what they are told.</p>

<p>Little Jimmy, for instance, was never happy
unless he was frightening womenkind, and one
afternoon three or four days after they had
arrived, when the mistress and her servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
were getting tea ready, he scuttled across the
room, helter-skelter, right under their eyes.
The girl saw him first and threw the toasting
fork on to the best tea-things, breaking two
cups and saucers with it; she bounded on to
a chair, pulled her skirts tight round her legs
and screamed out, &#8220;Beetles! Black ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment the mistress dropped the kettle,
which nearly crushed little Jimmy, and
jumped on to the table herself, screaming
louder than the servant. Little Jimmy could
hardly get under the skirting board, he was
laughing so, and old Butterwops, looking out
cautiously from the wood pile grunted to himself,
&#8220;Little Jimmy again,&#8221; for he knew who
must have done it as soon as he heard the
women screaming.</p>

<p>How long the two ladies might have stayed
there screaming before they would have dared
to step down on to the floor again I do not
know, but the master of the house came in just
then, and hearing the cause of the trouble
laughed aloud and said. &#8220;If there are beetles,
I will get a beetle trap.&#8221; And he did so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>That night he brought one into the kitchen,
and before they went to bed he and his wife
mixed up a dose of treacle and sugar and put
it in the trap and left the trap on the floor.
Butterwops was looking on all the time from
out of the wood pile, and he laughed all down
the back of his shell at them. He had seen
that kind of beetle trap before. It was a box
of wood, with sloping sides to walk up and a
sort of inkstand in the middle, leading to the
sugar and treacle. When you walk up the
sides, you smelled the mixture and if you went
to the edge of the glass inkstand, you stepped
in and got drowned. There was no getting
out of it.</p>

<p>That night Butterwops was very anxious
about the other beetles, for he knew what duffers
they were, so he got down right away and
sat on the edge of the trap and told them all
about it. As the master of the house had
been foolish enough to leave the sugar and
treacle on the table, no one bothered about
the trap. They had a merry feast, only spoilt
by one giddy young beetle tumbling head first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
into the treacle pot, and there the master found
him when he came down to light the fire.
When he found nothing in the trap, and the
dead beetle in the treacle pot on the table, he
seemed very angry and threw both treacle
and trap out of the scullery window, across
the garden into the ashpit.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will have a hedge-hog!&#8221;</p>

<p>Butterwops, who had stuck his head out of
his crack to see what was going on, drew it
back quickly and shuddered at this, for he
knew what hedge-hogs were. His grandfather
had been eaten by one in a garden close
to the house, and he had heard they were terrible
fellows for catching beetles, as indeed
they are.</p>

<p>Sure enough, that night the master brought
home a hedge-hog, a little prickly round ball
in a basket. He unrolled himself by the fire
and had a cup of milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us call him Curlywig,&#8221; said the mistress,
as she poured out the milk; &#8220;he is such
a little darling. See him drink.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>So they called him Curlywig; but he paid
no attention to them, and curled up on the
rug and went to sleep.</p>

<p>That night Butterwops did not come down
from the fireplace, but looked out from the
wood pile in great trouble. When all his
army of beetles were creeping and crawling
over the floor, picking up food and having a
rare good time, he kept shouting out from the
edge of a log: &#8220;Do go home! Do go in!
There&#8217;s a hedge-hog in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>But some of the beetles went close to Curlywig
to look at him, and came back and said to
Butterwops: &#8220;Nonsense, it&#8217;s only a mop-head.
You are growing old and nervous, General.
Go to bed and let us eat in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost as soon as they had spoken, Curlywig
unrolled himself, and darting here and
there and everywhere, went round the room
cracking up beetles furiously while poor old
Butterwops sat wringing his feelers and crying
out from the wood pile: &#8220;I told you so!
I told you so!&#8221;</p>

<p>From that time onwards, there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
peace for beetles. If one put his head up
above a crack in the floor, Curlywig was on
to him and he was snapped up. In three days,
one hundred and four beetles had been eaten,
and the rest were all starving. Butterwops
himself had not tasted bite or sup all the time,
and you could hear little Jimmy crying behind
the skirting board that he had nothing
to eat and was very hungry.</p>

<p>How long this might have gone on no one
can say, but at last Butterwops hit on a bright
idea, and the next night as soon as the people
of the house were in bed, he came to the edge
of the wood pile and said to the hedge-hog:
&#8220;Mr. Curlywig, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Curlywig looked up, and seeing a beetle,
snapped his jaws at him but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Curlywig, sir, can you explain to me
why you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To eat beetles, I suppose. What better
job can you have? I&#8217;d eat you if you would
come down, though you look rather old and
tough, and there are lots of young ones left
yet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;Ah, but I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t come down, thank you,&#8221;
said Butterwops, smiling blandly. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221;
he continued, as if he was merely thinking
it out, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what it is like
to be eaten, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; said Curlywig, &#8220;How should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; said Butterwops.
&#8220;Poor little fellow, how should he! It seems
a cruel shame to bring him here for that.
Poor little fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is a poor little fellow?&#8221; asked Curlywig,
rather angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the mistress said, while you
were asleep,&#8221; said Butterwops, innocently,
&#8220;as she was making the pie-crust. She said,
&#8216;Poor little fellow, I hope they won&#8217;t hurt him
skinning him!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Curlywig shivered in every prickle. &#8220;Who
is to be skinned?&#8221; he snapped out, looking
round nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cookery book was open at Hedge-hog
Tart,&#8221; went on Butterwops, quite coolly, as
though he was talking about the weather, &#8220;and
the servant said at the rate you were eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
beetles she thought you would be fat enough
by to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! dear me!&#8221; said Curlywig; &#8220;what
wicked things these men are. I remember
now when the master of the house bought
me, he said: &#8216;Lean little beggar this, but he&#8217;ll
soon fatten up at our house for we are full
of black beetles,&#8217; What wretches they are!
What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I can learn,&#8221; continued Butterwops,
&#8220;it is done like this. You take a young
hedge-hog, the fatter the better, first remove
the prickles and skin quickly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do be quiet,&#8221; groaned Curlywig, rolling
himself up into a ball. &#8220;What shall I do?
What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is to say,&#8221; said Butterwops, &#8220;that is
how it is done if they decide on tart. If it&#8217;s to
be curry you won&#8217;t be skinned, only then you
will catch it hotter in the saucepan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; shouted Curlywig, running
round the kitchen table in despair. &#8220;Oh my
poor prickles! What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I were you,&#8221; continued the General,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
calmly, &#8220;I do not think I should stay on,
but do not go on my account. You might
squeeze under the scullery door if you wanted
to, or you may stay and be eaten and I have
no doubt you will look as handsome in a tart
as you do out of it. But after all, handsome
is as handsome does, and the real question is
what will you taste like. Now you will never
know, but I shall hear all about it. Yes,&#8221;
chuckled Buttercups, &#8220;I shall hear all about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curlywig was now galloping round the
room mad with terror, shouting out: &#8220;Oh, my
poor prickles! Oh, my poor prickles!&#8221;</p>

<p>Butterwops continued slowly as though he
was addressing a dear friend. &#8220;I am really
very sorry for you, but don&#8217;t worry so much.
They are going to put some steak and kidney
in the pie, so you will have company; and I
dare say being baked is not bad, though I fear
you won&#8217;t like the skinning, especially this
chilly weather. But it will soon be over, and
once inside the oven you will be warm again
in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Curlywig did not hear all this. He had
heard enough. The foolish fellow believed
every word Butterwops said to him, and when
he came to the word skinning, Curlywig uttered
a wild shriek and away he fled underneath
the scullery door, across the garden,
out into the fields beyond the church, where
he hid in a dry ditch for three days, and dared
not move out for fear the people of the house
were hunting him.</p>

<p>Then the beetles had peace and grew up
with the children who came to stay at that
house, and cleaned up the floors, and kept
out of sight as much as might be. Even little
Jimmy grew wiser and gave up frightening
the mistress. No one ever heard of Curlywig
any more. And everyone in that house, from
the master of it down to little Jimmy, lived
happily ever afterwards.</p>

<p>This much more there is to tell: that if
you can make friends with a black beetle you
should get him to tell you stories of Butterwops.
And this any good beetle will do willingly,
for there never has been such a General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
as he was before or since. But of all the many
tales of his valour and wisdom, there is none
they love to tell better than the story of how
he outwitted Curlywig the Hedge-hog.
&#8220;That,&#8221; as little Jimmy said at a dinner given
by all the beetles to their General to celebrate
Curlywig&#8217;s flight, &#8220;is a story fit to be written
in letters of Treacle on the Skirting Boards
of Time.&#8221; (Adapted.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FINIKIN AND HIS GOLDEN PIPPINS</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Madame De Chatelaine</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a quiet little village surrounded by woods,
there once lived a poor couple who owned
nothing in the world but their cottage which
sheltered them and a bit of ground where a
few vegetables grew. They were blessed with
two pretty little twin boys, much alike in
face, though very different in character. One
was a tidy, diligent, active little fellow, whom,
on account of his delicate beauty, his mother
used to call Finikin. The other was an idle,
careless child, who always loitered if sent on
an errand, and grumbled when asked to do
any kind of work. This one the mother called
Winikin.</p>

<p>The father earned a little money by going
out to work as a day labourer. As long as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
remained hale and hearty, he managed to provide
for the wants of his family. But one summer
he fell ill, and as they were too poor to
buy good food and medicine he grew worse
and worse, till at length his recovery seemed
almost hopeless.</p>

<p>One day the patient wife thought of a good
old hermit who lived in the neighboring forest,
and who often gave advice to the poor
cottagers. He had cured many a one with
medicine made from plants and other homely
remedies. She, therefore, called her boys and
bade them go and ask the hermit what could
be done for their sick father.</p>

<p>&#8220;The good man may send you to gather
healing plants,&#8221; she said, &#8220;such as he often
points out to the villagers. Be sure to follow
his directions carefully and above all, do not
loiter on the way.&#8221; She divided a rye-cake
between them, to eat by the way, and off
started the two boys for the forest. No sooner
had they reached it than they saw from afar
an old huntsman smoking his pipe under a
tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Winikin, forgetting his mother&#8217;s
caution, &#8220;there is old Roger! Let&#8217;s go
to him instead of to the hermit. He always
tells us such pleasant stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But father is very sick and mother told
us not to loiter on the way,&#8221; said Finikin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said Winikin, &#8220;Roger&#8217;s advice
will be as good as the hermit&#8217;s. I shall not
go any farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Finikin trudged on alone to the good
old man&#8217;s cell where he found him making
medicine from herbs he had gathered in the
forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good hermit,&#8221; said Finikin eagerly, &#8220;will
you not give me some of your medicine for
my sick father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, indeed,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;But
my child there is something more than these
herbs needed to cure your father; and it must
be fetched from a long distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go anywhere for it,&#8221; declared Finikin,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my son,&#8221; replied the hermit, &#8220;you
must go to a garden five or six miles off. None<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
but little children like yourself can enter;
therefore, it would be of no use if I or any
other grown person attempted to go with you.
This garden is situated on top of a cluster of
high rocks. Should you have the perseverance
to reach it, you will find it full of trees,
bearing all kinds of fruit which several little
boys always keep gathering. You must ask
them to give you some golden pippins for
your father. If they consent all will be well;
but if they try to keep you to play with them,
you must not stay, for the hours would pass
so quickly, that your father might die before
you returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finikin listened very carefully. &#8220;Please
tell me the way to this wonderful garden,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The hermit opened the door at the back
of his cell, which led to a small piece of
ground where he grew his vegetables. He
showed Finikin a kind of tunnel hollowed out
in a grotto through which he could see a distant
view of green meadows and blue mountains,
and told him that way would lead him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
in the right direction. He then described
carefully all the objects the lad was to pass
on the road, and told him above all things
neither to idle as he went along nor listen
to anyone who should offer to show him a
shorter way. Finikin promised he would not,
and thanking the hermit, lost no time in starting
off to find the wonderful garden where
the golden pippins grew.</p>

<p>Winikin, meanwhile, after losing at least
half an hour talking to the old huntsman, and
playing with his dog, suddenly thought how
heartless he had been, and asked Roger to tell
what he had better do to help his father to
get well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not stand idling here, youngster, for
one thing,&#8221; said Roger; &#8220;and next go and ask
advice of the hermit, who knows better than
anyone else what can be done to save your
father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but my brother has gone there, so it
is of no use for me to go too,&#8221; said Winikin;
&#8220;and he is too far for me to catch him, so please
tell me something else I can do instead!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>The huntsman thought awhile, and at last
said: &#8220;I have heard of a wonderful garden
some three miles east of the forest, where all
kinds of fruits made of precious stones grow
all the year round. The currants are rubies,
the apples are topazes, and the plums are
amethysts or sapphires. If you are able to
reach this garden and gather a basketful of
cherries you might enrich yourself and family
for life; and then your father might have
the best doctors. He would want for nothing
and might soon get well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winikin was delighted at the idea of such a
garden, and asked Roger to show him the way
to it.</p>

<p>The old huntsman then took him to a kind
of grotto that was so completely hidden by
brushwood that the little boy had never seen
it before though he had often crossed that
part of the forest. When the twigs that
choked up the entry had been put aside he
saw a hollow passage and a view of distant
meadows and hills. Then Roger carefully
described all the objects the lad was to pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
on the road, so that he could not miss the way.
Also, he bade him not to loiter on the way for
fear he should not be back by nightfall.</p>

<p>Winikin now entered the grotto but kept
stopping every minute to admire its pretty
sparkling walls, which glistened like diamonds
and rubies as a sunbeam shone through the
narrow opening. At last, however, he came
out into the open meadows, in a part of a
country which he had never seen before. Here
he met a beautiful little boy with golden locks
and cheeks as blooming as a ripe peach. He
was carrying a couple of hoops on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come and play with me?&#8221; asked
the little stranger whose name was Goldlocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Winikin slowly, thinking of
the huntsman&#8217;s advice not to loiter on the way,
&#8220;I should like that very much, but I&#8217;m going
to a beautiful garden beyond the hills and I&#8217;m
afraid of being too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t fear that,&#8221; said the little boy,
&#8220;for we will trundle our hoops that way. You
will get on much faster with a hoop than
without one. Come!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The lad offered Winikin one of the hoops
which were made of finely worked silver. Also,
there was a small ivory stick to trundle
it with.</p>

<p>Winikin could not resist. He took a beautiful
hoop and stick from Goldlocks who said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, twice, thrice, away!&#8221; and off they
went like the wind.</p>

<p>Winikin thought to reach the hills in about
five minutes, but at a turn in the road little
Goldlocks kept trundling on his hoop faster
than before.</p>

<p>Winikin suspected they were not taking the
shortest road to the hills, but fearing Goldlocks
would win the game he sped after him
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>At length Winikin stopped and was panting
for breath. Goldlocks laughed and stopped,
too, saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s enough of hoop-trundling!&#8221;
and he flung them over a hedge into
a neighbouring field. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll stop and
rest and play at marbles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he drew from his pocket some pearls
as large and round as other children&#8217;s marbles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and Winikin, who dearly loved this game,
could not resist playing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come along so fast,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;that no time will be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now high noon and the sun had
grown so hot that Winikin felt tired and
thirsty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go into this wood and gather strawberries,&#8221;
said Goldlocks.</p>

<p>Winikin thought the idea was excellent, so
he said, &#8220;Yes, we shall get on faster after we
have eaten some fruit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, the little boys went into the
wood, and, in about five minutes, Goldlocks
had gathered enough strawberries to fill Winikin&#8217;s
hat. They were larger and more delicious
than any he had ever tasted before.</p>

<p>When Winikin had eaten his fill, he wished
to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said his companion, &#8220;it is still too
hot to walk fast. If you wait awhile under
the shade of this pretty wood, you will get
on all the better a little later in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Winikin, and the lads sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
down on the grass. Goldlocks now drew from
his pocket a humming top and set it spinning.
It was made of a single carbuncle and was
topped at each end with a diamond. It was
called a humming top but it should have been
called a musical top for the sounds it gave
forth were as beautiful as an Eolian harp,
and they formed distinct tunes. Winikin listened
in speechless joy, till at length, tired
out with play and amusement, he fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Little Finikin, meanwhile, on getting out
into the meadows, carefully noticed all the
objects the hermit had described, so as to be
sure to lose neither time nor way till at last
he came to a field where he saw a little boy
sitting on a bank, and crying bitterly.</p>

<p>Finikin felt so sorry for him that he stopped
and said, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;I am waiting for someone
to play with. My name is Brownlocks. Who
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Finikin,&#8221; said our little friend, &#8220;but
I cannot stop to play. I am trying to find an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
orchard of wonderful fruit. I shall take some
of it back to my sick father. The fruit will
help to cure him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play with me awhile,&#8221; said Brownlocks.
&#8220;I can take you to a garden where you will
find better fruit than that which grows in the
orchard you are looking for.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Finikin remembered the hermit&#8217;s words
and persisted in going on his way. When he
looked to see if the little boy was following
him, Finikin found he had disappeared.</p>

<p>Finikin hurried on, and at length the scenery
began to grow wilder as he came near the
end of his journey. The rocks were higher
and more abrupt and the vegetation more luxuriant,
and soon in great joy he stopped, looked
at the top of a great pile of rocks, and cried
out, &#8220;There is the wonderful garden! It
looks like a giant basket of fruit and flowers!
How shall I ever climb up to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finikin went round the base of the rocks
and looked carefully to see if he could find
a path leading to the summit. No such thing
was to be found but he saw a cleft between two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
rocks over which fell a cascade. The water
had shrunk to a mere thread because the season
had been very dry. Either the work of
nature or the hand of man had formed rocks
into rough steps, which were almost covered
with a sheet of water. Finikin determined
to climb the steps although they were slippery
and dangerous. Slowly and carefully he made
his way to the top where a hedge formed a
circle round the garden. He crept through
the prickly bushes and saw before him an
earthly paradise. The grass was dotted over
with every variety of rare, richly coloured
flowers; the trees were loaded with fruit that
shone like precious stones; the air was studded
with the gayest butterflies; and birds with
gold and silver plumage were hopping from
branch to branch and trilling the sweetest
songs.</p>

<p>Though Finikin was dazzled and charmed
by all he saw, he walked on without stopping
until he came to some little boys who were
gathering plums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who comes here?&#8221; said the boys on seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the little stranger. &#8220;And how did you get into
our garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come from the hermit in the forest,&#8221;
cried Finikin. &#8220;He said you could give me
some pippins that would cure my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if you come from the hermit you shall
have some pippins,&#8221; said one of the boys who
was Brownlocks. &#8220;Only you must gather
them yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they led Finikin to another tree with
a trunk as smooth and shining as glass. Golden
pippins grew on the great branches at the top
of the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gather as many as you like,&#8221; said the little
boys.</p>

<p>Finikin then began to climb the tree. He
kept slipping down every moment and, strange
to say, the trunk kept growing higher and
higher as if it would reach the sky.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Finikin had a lot
of chalk in his pocket. By crumbling it to
pieces in his hands he managed to grasp the
tree trunk firmly and after many patient efforts
he reached the top of the tree. He now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
filled his hat and pockets with pippins that
were as clear as topazes. The fruit was very
heavy and when Finikin began to descend the
tree his load of pippins was so heavy that it
dragged him down faster and faster until he
reached the ground. It was now twilight.
The boys had picked up all their plums and
had gone.</p>

<p>Finikin looked around in all directions, and
finally, he discovered in the distance a gleam
of light. He walked quickly up to it and
found it came from a fruit storehouse of white
marble. Here were silver filigree baskets
filled with every kind of fruit and arranged
neatly on shelves. All the fruit in the silver
baskets was soft and eatable, while that in the
golden baskets was turned to precious stones!
The dark plums were sapphires and amethysts;
the greengages and gooseberries, emeralds;
the cherries, garnets; the white-hearts,
rubies, dark on one side and almost white on
the other; the black currants, black pearls. A
number of beautiful empty baskets were hanging
on gold and silver hooks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Here Finikin found one of the boys, who
wished him joy of his success, and after helping
him to empty his pippins into a gold basket,
the lad led Finikin down a flight of greenish
marble steps into a beautiful hall which
was lighted up with mother-of-pearl lamps
hanging from the ceiling. Here in the center
of the room supper was laid. The table was
of citron-wood, and round the board were
set cedar stools. On the walls countless toys
of every description hung on golden hooks.</p>

<p>Finikin was so hungry after his day&#8217;s work
that he was glad enough to sit down and eat
his supper.</p>

<p>When their meal was over Brownlocks
said: &#8220;Now, Finikin, we will play some
games.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Finikin begged leave to go, as it was
already late and he was afraid he could not
reach home till the night was half spent.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are afraid of being out in the
night,&#8221; said one of the little friends, &#8220;you may
stay and sleep in the empty bed of one of our
comrades who is absent; and to-morrow, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
sunrise, we will go with you a part of the way,
and play together as we go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not stay,&#8221; said Finikin. &#8220;My father
is very ill, dear friends, and I hope to reach
home before it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall do as you like,&#8221; said the boys.
Then one of them took down from the wall
a stick with a nag&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this toy with you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It was a very simple toy, but Finikin was
delighted with the gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will carry you six times as fast as a
horse, wherever you wish to go,&#8221; cried the little
boys.</p>

<p>Finikin clapped his hands for joy and said,
&#8220;May I have a toy for Winikin, my brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; they said, &#8220;Winikin must come himself
for a toy. We cannot send him one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finikin thanked the lads and wished them
good-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Finikin,&#8221; they cried; &#8220;you
may come to see us every Midsummer Eve
on your nag. <i>He</i> will always find the way
although you couldn&#8217;t. Good-night!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>So Finikin left Magic Toyland. As soon
as he was out-of-doors and had placed his basket
of pippins on his arm he mounted his stick
with the nag&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Away he started! He had scarcely time to
wonder how he should manage to ride down
the steep rocks. He seemed to be sinking
deeper and deeper and without knowing how,
he found himself in the long narrow passage
leading to the hermit&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>All this time Winikin lay asleep in the
woods. The sun was low in the western sky
when he opened his eyes and saw Goldlocks
sitting on the grass playing with a cup and
ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lend me that plaything,&#8221; said Winikin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Goldlocks, &#8220;I have something
which two of us can play with.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to a couple of golden drums
covered with finest vellum that were lying
in the grass. The drumsticks were of ebony
inlaid with mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play hide-and seek,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
hide first and then I will beat my drum and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
you must try to guess from the sound where I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be good fun,&#8221; said Winikin.</p>

<p>Goldlocks ran and hid himself. At the beating
of the drum Winikin found him quite
easily. Then Winikin hid but he had hardly
struck the drum with his stick until there was
Goldlocks! So they played for some time but
at last Goldlocks hid himself so well that,
though he kept beating his drum, Winikin
could not find him. He ran to the right and
to the left but it was of no use. The sound
seemed to come from all directions at once.
He tapped his own drum, and cried out,
&#8220;Come back, Goldlocks! Where are you?
Come back!&#8221;</p>

<p>He beat his drum so hard that it snapped!
It was growing very dark! The brambles
grew thicker at every step! The sound of
Goldlocks&#8217; drum was growing fainter and
fainter until at last Winikin could not hear it
at all. He scratched his hands and tore his
clothes at every step, but at last he found a
path which led out of the thick wood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>He walked along until he came to a small
lake; &#8220;Oh! what shall I do,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
missed the way old Roger told me to take!
Where shall I stay to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little while he saw Goldlocks with
smiling face coming towards him. The lad
carried a couple of battledores, covered with
silver nets. The handles were of richly carved
gold. He had a shuttlecock, too, which was
made from the plumes of a hummingbird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter?&#8221; asked Goldlocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I thought you had run away, and
left me,&#8221; cried Winikin. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve lost my
way! I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play a game of battledore,&#8221; was
Goldlocks&#8217; answer.</p>

<p>Winikin dried his tears and said. &#8220;Tell me
where you get such pretty toys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve plenty more at home, and prettier
ones than these,&#8221; replied his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would take me home with you,&#8221;
said Winikin. &#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;There across the lake,&#8221; said the little boy,
pointing to some distant hills.</p>

<p>The lads now played a game of battledore
and kept tossing the shuttlecock higher and
higher till at last it fell into the lake at a
great distance, but remained floating on the
surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us jump in and see who will catch it
first,&#8221; said Goldlocks.</p>

<p>Away he darted into the water, and soon
swam out of sight among the bulrushes that
grew on an islet in the middle of the lake.
Winikin believed he could swim, too, so into
the water he jumped. In the dusk a white
water-lily looked like the lost shuttlecock.
Poor Winikin snatched at it, lost his balance,
and fell down in the water. He tried to
scream out to his companion, but he could not
make a sound. After this he could not remember
what took place.</p>

<p>Luckily the lake was not deep; he quickly
rose to the surface and the gentle waves bore
him to the shore where he lay insensible for
several hours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>It was near daybreak when Winikin came
to his senses again. He stared about wondering
whether it was all a dream, or whether
he had really played with Goldlocks the day
before. Then he saw one of the battledores
lying besides him and the lost shuttlecock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better stop here, or else he won&#8217;t
find me if he returns,&#8221; thought Winikin.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw a little boy galloping
along as fast as his wooden horse would
carry him! It was Finikin!</p>

<p>The good little fellow had carried home
his basket of fruit and had seen his father
improve after eating one of the golden pippins.
Then he had gone to find Roger, the huntsman,
who said he had sent Winikin to the
magical garden. Away went Finikin at full
speed, like a small knight-errant, to seek his
brother.</p>

<p>Of course Winikin was ashamed when he
heard what his brother had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go to the wonderful garden and
bring back a basket of cherries,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Perhaps they will give me a hobby-horse!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Nothing shall tempt me again to idle on the
way. Will you not lend me your wooden
nag, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, take it and hurry along,&#8221; said Finikin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee-ho!&#8221; cried Winikin striding the stick.
But the nag would not stir a bit faster than
other sticks that children play with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; said Finikin. &#8220;Get up behind
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Away went the little lads on the wooden
horse. In a little while they came to the foot
of the rocks, where Finikin left his brother.
Then Finikin galloped home for the little
boys had told him not to come again until
Midsummer Eve.</p>

<p>When he was gone Winikin sat down and
wondered how he should ever reach the garden.
Perhaps the little boys would come out
and help him. At least he would let them
know where he was. He began to toss up the
shuttlecock. Away it soared as if it had wings
and lighted on a tree in the garden. At this
moment a few red streaks were seen in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
sky and the little boys came out into the garden.
One of them saw the shuttlecock!</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Winikin. I am Finikin&#8217;s twin
brother,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked the boy in the
garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see your pretty toys! and I want
a basket of cherries,&#8221; said Winikin.</p>

<p>The garden lads let down a basket and drew
him up. There was Goldlocks as merry and
mischievous looking as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;You left me in the water, Goldlocks!&#8221; said
Winikin to his playfellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I had lost too much time to stay any
longer,&#8221; said Goldlocks. &#8220;Come, let us have
breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all sat down on the grass under the
trees and feasted on strawberries and cream
served in the finest porcelain bowls.</p>

<p>After breakfast Winikin said, &#8220;Now let
us play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! we must gather fruit first! There is
work to be done. You had better gather your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
basket of cherries,&#8221; said one of the lads. &#8220;The
cherry trees are over there. Gather a basketful
from the one which stands in the middle.&#8221;
The lads then went about their work.</p>

<p>With his usual idle habits Winikin began
plucking flowers and chasing butterflies.
When his little friends came to fetch him to
play games, they found he was not a jot farther
than when they left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t play with you, Winikin, until
you have gathered your fruit,&#8221; said Goldlocks.</p>

<p>And then he laid a golden trap-ball down
on the grass, and the five little boys began to
play merrily.</p>

<p>Winikin saw that he must work before he
could join them at play so he began to climb
the tree. What a long time it took him to
reach the top. The fine cherries which were
white-hearts were so ripe and juicy you may
be sure he ate a good many of them. But at
last he filled his pockets, descended the tree
and lay down on the grass tired out with his
work.</p>

<p>After a time the lads came to fetch him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
dinner. They first led him through the fruit-chamber
where they helped him to empty
his pockets into a silver filigree basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put all you have brought into the basket,&#8221;
said one of the lads; &#8220;for your cherries will
harden into rubies in two or three days. Come
now into the hall where dinner is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winikin could scarcely eat for looking at
the toys in the magical hall. When the meal
was over he asked leave to play with some of
them.</p>

<p>The boys showed him a great many playthings
he had never seen before but at last
one of them said, &#8220;It is time to start, Winikin,
if you wish to reach home before night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you give me a little wooden nag
like my brother&#8217;s?&#8221; asked Winikin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t another in our collection but
you may have this toy,&#8221; they answered giving
him an agate cup and ball fastened to a delicate
gold chain.</p>

<p>Winikin was well pleased with this toy and
taking up his basket, he followed the little
boys down a long, long flight of steps which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
brought them to the bottom of the rocks where
he saw a little crack just large enough for
him to creep through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that large brown butterfly
whose wings are tipped with dark blue?&#8221;
asked Goldlocks. &#8220;Follow him. If you don&#8217;t
lose sight of him he will show you the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Winikin started. The butterfly kept
bobbing up and down, now lighting on this
flower, and now on that. In fact Winikin
could very easily keep up with him. But at
a turn in the road a splendid butterfly rose
out of a bush. Away darted Winikin after
him although the lad noticed that the brown
butterfly went in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can soon catch up with old Browncoat
again,&#8221; thought Winikin.</p>

<p>Sunwings, the beautiful butterfly, led Winikin
a fine dance over bank and bush, but at
last the lad was obliged to give up the chase.
He was a little surprised to find that he had
lost some of his cherries in running after the
golden butterfly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back and find old Browncoat,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
said to himself. &#8220;After all the loss of a few
cherries does not matter much. How thirsty
I am. A few cherries will refresh me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he sat down and ate several and then took
out his cup and ball to amuse himself. After
awhile he got up and again tried to find his
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;How hungry and thirsty I am,&#8221; he thought,
taking one cherry after another from his basket
until it was almost emptied.</p>

<p>After wandering about until twilight he
found himself at the foot of the rocks on top
of which was the magic garden. He tried to
find the crevice through which he had crept
out that morning but a foaming cascade was
dashing down over it.</p>

<p>He shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost
my way, boys. Let me eat supper with you in
the hall of toys and sleep here for the
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have eaten supper,&#8221; answered the
boys; &#8220;but you shall have some. We can&#8217;t
let you stay all night for we have no spare
bed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>They let down a basket and drew Winikin
up as before and after taking him into the
hall they went to bed. After he had eaten
a hearty meal the boys called out to him to
put out the lights and leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Winikin, &#8220;how am I to get out
of the garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldlocks peeped out of his snowy bed
and said, &#8220;There is a bat outside which will
show you the way, and if you follow him better
than you did the butterfly you will reach
home in fairly good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Winikin put out the lamps in the
sleeping-room, but before he put out the lights
in the large hall he couldn&#8217;t resist sauntering
around once more to look at the toys. When
he reached the door that led to the fruit-chamber
he thought he might as well fill up his
basket again, as a few cherries could not be
missed from such a quantity. This he did.
Then fearing the boys would chide him for his
delay he began to put out the lights. Very
foolishly he started with the one nearest the
outer door, so that by the time he reached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
end of the long hall and put out the last lamp,
he found himself in the dark.</p>

<p>Winikin was now so frightened that he
didn&#8217;t know what to do, for, if he tried to move
in the dark he would be sure to overturn the
table or the stools, so he cowered down in the
corner hoping the boys would fall asleep and
forget him, and that next morning he might
escape before they were up. But presently
he heard the boys get up very softly and come
into the hall saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s a thief here!&#8221;
Winikin held his breath, and hoped to escape
without notice; but they marched up to the
corner where he lay hid just as if it had been
broad daylight. Each had a rod in his hand
and Winikin received a sound thrashing. At
last he cried out, &#8220;It is only I. Don&#8217;t hurt
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they stopped and dragged Winikin
out of the hall. They emptied the basket of
the cherries he had taken, which were easily
distinguished from the others, as in his hurry
he had helped himself out of a golden basket
to some cherries that had hardened into rubies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Then the lads fetched an ivory ladder of great
length and putting it over the hedge they
forced him to leave the garden at once.</p>

<p>Winikin cried bitterly when he saw the
ladder taken up again but at last he began to
think he had better make the best of a bad
bargain. So he set off and, as Goldlocks had
promised, a bat flew before him to show him
the way.</p>

<p>For awhile he followed his leader carefully
and made good resolutions as he went along,
but alas! Suddenly a troop of fireflies flitted
past him, and he said to himself, &#8220;How much
better they would light me than this tiresome
bat which keeps flapping his wings in my eyes!
The fireflies are like so many lanterns and
surely they&#8217;ll know the way best.&#8221; But they
led him into a bog where he spent the
night.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, he looked round
for some hut where he could ask his way, but
he recollected to his horror that neither yesterday
nor the day before had he seen even a
single being stirring anywhere. He saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
he was within a charmed circle, and kept turning
to no purpose. After toiling for some time
he again recognized familiar objects, and the
well-known garden in the distance. Winikin
hardly dared again apply to the little boys, yet
having eaten all the cherries to appease his
hunger, and seeing no chance of freeing himself
from his desperate position, he went to the
rocks and clapped hands. Presently the boys
appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who dares to come a third time unbidden?&#8221;
said they.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; cried the foolish wanderer, &#8220;I have
again lost my way, and eaten all the cherries.
Please take pity and let me come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said they, &#8220;you do not deserve to
come into our garden any more; and as you are
not to be trusted to go home, and we don&#8217;t
wish to be disturbed by you again, we shall
now send you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, they disappeared for a moment,
and soon crept out at the foot of the rocks,
bringing with them a go-cart, into which they
put Winikin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; they cried out, and away it
darted, at the speed which would shame
an express train.</p>

<p>The go-cart, which was indeed worthy of
its name, ran over hill and dale, rocks and
water till Winikin thought every moment he
would be dashed to pieces. At length it
stopped when it reached his native village,
before the door of a fine large farmhouse, and
then, as if to make up for the lost time the
moment Winikin had got out, it darted away
again at double speed and went back to the
magical garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221; said Winikin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
our cottage anywhere.&#8221; And then he stopped
a passer-by, and said to him: &#8220;Where do my
parents live? For some reason I can&#8217;t find
the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight before your nose, you young idler,&#8221;
said the man.</p>

<p>At the same moment his mother appeared at
the door of the farm house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Winikin,&#8221; she said, putting her arms
around him, &#8220;you have been a long time, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
I suppose you have brought something worth
the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>It must be explained, that what had appeared
three days to Winikin was, in fact,
three weeks, for in that enchanted region a
single day was equal in time to a week in
the ordinary world. Finikin had escaped
from this law, because he had returned before
midnight, and consequently, had not spent a
whole day away from home.</p>

<p>The mother then led Winikin into the house
where he found Finikin and his father, who
had quite recovered since he had eaten one
of the golden pippins. All the rest of them
had hardened into topazes, and had been sold
by the parents to a rich jeweler in the nearest
town. The money received had served to
buy and stock the farm where they were living.
The old cottage had been pulled down,
and a barn was going to be built on its site.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the father, &#8220;though you
are too late, Winny, to do me any good, let us
see what you have brought.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winikin was very much ashamed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
nothing to show but an empty basket nor did
he improve matters by telling his parents that
&#8220;there had been some very fine cherries in it.&#8221;
However, what was done could not now be
mended, and the only thing left for Winikin
was to try to improve.</p>

<p>For a long time after, whenever he went on
a message, the villagers would say: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
three weeks on the road, as when you went to
fetch cherries for your sick father.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still further ashamed when midsummer
came round again and his brother
set off for the beautiful garden on his little
nag, while Winikin had only a cup and ball,
that gave him a rap on the head every time
he played with it when he ought to have been
doing something else!</p>

<p>After receiving many raps, however, he
learned that he must not take out his toy except
at the proper time.</p>

<p>As long as their childhood lasted Finikin
continued to visit the little boys, but when
he began to grow too big to play with them,
they bade him affectionately farewell, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
a parting gift they gave him branches of their
apple-tree and cherry-tree. When these were
grafted on two trees at the farmhouse they
produced the finest fruit ever eaten. The
cherries were the first white-hearts and the apples
were ever since called golden pippins, on
account of their origin. (Adapted.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE STORY OF FAIRYFOOT</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frances Browne</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, there stood far away in
the west country a town called Stumpinghame.
It contained seven windmills, a royal
palace, a market-place, and a prison, with
every other convenience befitting the capital
of a kingdom. It stood in the midst of a great
plain, which for three leagues round its walls
was covered with corn, flax, and orchards.
Beyond that lay a great circle of pasture land,
and it was bounded on all sides by a forest
so thick and old that no man in Stumpinghame
knew its extent; and the opinion of the
learned was, that it reached to the end of the
world.</p>

<p>There were strong reasons for this opinion.
First, that forest was known to be inhabited
time out of mind by the fairies, and no hunter
cared to go beyond its borders&mdash;so all the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
country believed it to be solidly full of old
trees from end to end. Secondly, the people
of Stumpinghame were no travellers&mdash;man,
woman, and child had feet so large and heavy
that it was by no means convenient to carry
them far. Great feet had been the fashion
there from time immemorial, and the higher
the family the larger were their feet.</p>

<p>Stumpinghame had a king of its own, and
his name was Stiffstep; his family was very
ancient and large-footed. His subjects called
him Lord of the World, and he made a speech
to them every year concerning the grandeur
of his mighty empire. His queen, Hammerheel,
was the greatest beauty in Stumpinghame.
Her majesty&#8217;s shoe was not much less
than a fishing-boat. Their six children promised
to be quite as handsome, and all went well
with them till the birth of their seventh son.</p>

<p>For a long time nobody about the palace
could understand what was the matter&mdash;the
ladies-in-waiting looked so astonished, and
the king so vexed; but at last it was whispered
through the city that the queen&#8217;s seventh child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
had been born with such miserably small feet
that they resembled nothing ever seen or heard
of in Stumpinghame, except the feet of the
fairies.</p>

<p>All the relations of the king and queen assembled
at the palace to mourn with them
over the singular misfortune. The whole
court and most of the citizens helped in this
mourning; but when it had lasted seven days
they all found out it was of no use. So the
relations went to their homes, and the people
took to their work, and to cheer up the queen&#8217;s
spirits, the young prince was sent privately
out to the pasture lands, to be nursed among
the shepherds.</p>

<p>The chief man there was called Fleecefold,
and his wife&#8217;s name was Rough Ruddy. They
lived in a snug cottage with their son Blackthorn
and their daughter Brownberry, and
were thought great people, because they kept
the king&#8217;s sheep. Moreover, Fleecefold&#8217;s family
were known to be ancient; and Rough
Ruddy boasted that she had the largest feet
in all the pastures. The shepherds held them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
in high respect, and it grew still higher when
the news spread that the king&#8217;s seventh son
had been sent to their cottage.</p>

<p>The king and queen had given him fourteen
names, beginning with Augustus&mdash;such
being the fashion in the royal family; but the
honest country people could not remember so
many, so they called him Fairyfoot. At court
it was not thought polite to speak of him at
all. They did not keep his birthday, and he
was never sent for at Christmas, because the
queen and her ladies could not bear the sight.
Once a year the undermost scullion was sent
to see how he did, with a bundle of his next
brother&#8217;s cast-off clothes; and, as the king grew
old and cross, it was said he had thoughts of
disowning him.</p>

<p>So Fairyfoot grew in Fleecefold&#8217;s cottage.
Perhaps the country air made him fair and
rosy&mdash;for all agreed that he would have been
a handsome boy but for his feet, with which
nevertheless, he learned to walk, and in time
to run and to jump, thereby amazing everybody,
for such doings were not known among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the children of Stumpinghame. The news of
court, however, travelled to the shepherds,
and Fairyfoot was despised among them. The
old people thought him unlucky; the children
refused to play with him. Fleecefold was
ashamed to have him in his cottage, but he
durst not disobey the king&#8217;s orders. Moreover,
Blackthorn wore most of the clothes
brought by the scullion. At last, Rough Ruddy
found out that the sight of such horrid
jumping would make her children vulgar;
and, as soon as he was old enough she sent
Fairyfoot every day to watch some sickly sheep
that grazed on a wild, weedy pasture, near the
forest.</p>

<p>Poor Fairyfoot was lying in the shadow of
a mossy rock one warm summer&#8217;s noon, with
the sheep feeding round, when a robin, pursued
by a great hawk, flew into the old velvet
cap which lay on the ground beside him.
Fairyfoot covered it up, and the hawk, frightened
by his shout, flew away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you may go, poor robin!&#8221; he said,
opening the cap; but instead of the bird, out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
sprang a little man dressed in russet-brown,
and looking as if he were a hundred years
old. Fairyfoot could not speak for astonishment,
but the little man said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for your shelter, and be sure I
will do as much for you. Call on me if you
are ever in trouble, my name is Robin Goodfellow;&#8221;
and darting off he was out of sight
in an instant.</p>

<p>For days the boy wondered who that little
man could be, but he told nobody, for the
little man&#8217;s feet were as small as his own, and
it was clear he would be no favorite in Stumpinghame.
Fairyfoot kept the story to himself,
and at last midsummer came. That evening
was a feast among the shepherds. There were
bonfires on the hills, and fun in the villages.
But Fairyfoot sat alone beside his sheepfold,
for the children of the village had refused to
let him dance with them about the bonfire,
and he had never felt so lonely in all his life.
But remembering the little man, he plucked
up spirit, and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Robin Goodfellow!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; said a shrill voice at his elbow;
and there stood the little man himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very lonely, and no one will play
with me, because my feet are not large
enough,&#8221; said Fairyfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then, and play with us,&#8221; said the
little man. &#8220;We lead the merriest lives in
the world, and care for nobody&#8217;s feet; but
there are two things you must mind among
us; first, do as you see the rest doing; and, secondly,
never speak of anything you may hear
or see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do that, and anything more you
like,&#8221; said Fairyfoot; and the little man, taking
his hand, led him over the pasture into the
forest, and along a mossy path among old
trees wreathed with ivy, till they heard the
sound of music, and came upon a meadow
where the moon shone as bright as day, and
all the flowers of the year&mdash;snowdrops, violets,
primroses, and cowslips&mdash;bloomed together
in the thick grass. There was a crowd
of little men and women, some clad in russet
colour, but far more in green, dancing round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
a little well as clear as crystal. And under
great rose-trees which grew here and there in
the meadow, companies were sitting round low
tables covered with cups of milk and dishes
of honey. All the little people about the well
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, welcome!&#8221; and everyone said:
&#8220;Come and dance with me!&#8221; So Fairyfoot
was as happy as a prince, and drank milk and
ate honey till the moon was low in the sky, and
then the little man took him by the hand, and
never stopped nor stayed till he was at his
own bed of straw in the cottage corner.</p>

<p>Next morning Fairyfoot was not tired for
all his dancing. Nobody in the cottage had
missed him, and he went out with the sheep
as usual; but every night all that summer,
when the shepherds were safe in bed, the little
man came and took him away to dance in
the forest.</p>

<p>The wonder was that he was never tired
nor sleepy, as people are apt to be who dance
all night; but before the summer was ended
Fairyfoot found out the reason. One night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
when the moon was full, and the last of the
ripe corn rustling in the fields, Robin Goodfellow
came for him as usual, and away they
went to the flowery green. The fun there was
high, but never in all his life did Fairyfoot
find such hard work as to keep pace with the
company. Their feet seemed to move like
lightning. Fairyfoot did his best, for he never
gave in easily; but at length, his breath and
strength being spent, the boy was glad to steal
away and sit down behind a mossy oak, where
his eyes closed for very weariness. When he
awoke the dance was nearly over, but two little
ladies clad in green talked close behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beautiful boy!&#8221; said one of them.
&#8220;He is worthy to be a king&#8217;s son. Only see
what handsome feet he has!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, with a laugh that
sounded spiteful; &#8220;they are just like the feet
Princess Maybloom had before she washed
them in the Growing Well. Her father has
sent far and wide throughout the whole country
searching for a doctor to make them small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
again, but nothing in this world can do it except
the water on the Fair Fountain. And
only the nightingales and I know where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would not care to let the like be
known,&#8221; said the first little lady. &#8220;But you
will surely send word to the sweet princess&mdash;she
was so kind to our birds and butterflies,
and danced so like one of ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I, indeed!&#8221; said the spiteful fairy.
&#8220;Her old skinflint of a father cut down the
cedar which I loved best in the whole forest,
and made a chest of it to keep his money in;
besides, I never liked the princess&mdash;everybody
praised her so. But come, we shall be too
late for the last dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were gone, Fairyfoot could sleep
no more with astonishment. He did not wonder
at the fairies admiring his feet, because
their own were much the same; but it amazed
him that Princess Maybloom&#8217;s father should
be troubled at hers growing large. Moreover,
he wished to see that same princess and her
country.</p>

<p>When Robin Goodfellow came to take him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
home as usual he durst not let him know that
he had overheard anything; but never was
the boy so unwilling to get up as on that morning,
and all day he was so weary that in the
afternoon Fairyfoot fell asleep, with his head
on a clump of rushes. But it so happened
that towards evening the old shepherd, Fleecefold,
thought he would see how things went on
in the pastures. The shepherd had a bad temper
and a thick staff, and no sooner did he
catch sight of Fairyfoot sleeping, and his flock
straying away, than he shouted all the ill
names he could remember, and woke up the
boy who jumped up and ran away. The shepherd
ran after him as fast as his great feet
would allow. Fairyfoot, seeing no other shelter
from Fleecefold&#8217;s fury, fled into the forest,
and never stopped nor stayed till he reached
the banks of a little stream.</p>

<p>Thinking it might lead him to the fairies&#8217;
dancing ground, he followed that stream for
many an hour, but it wound away into the
heart of the forest flowing through dells, falling
over mossy rocks, and at last leading Fairyfoot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
when he was tired and the night had
fallen, to a grove of great rose-trees, with the
moon shining on it as bright as day, and thousands
of nightingales singing in the branches.
In the midst of that grove was a clear spring,
bordered with banks of lilies, and Fairyfoot
sat down by it to rest himself and listen. The
singing was so sweet he could have listened
forever, but as he sat the nightingales left
off their songs, and began to talk together in
the silence of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;What boy is that?&#8221; said one on a branch
above him. &#8220;He cannot have come from
Stumpinghame with such small and handsome
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll warrant you,&#8221; said another, &#8220;he
has come from the west country. How in the
world did he find the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How simple you are!&#8221; said a third nightingale.
&#8220;What had he to do but follow the
ground-ivy, which grows over height and hollow,
bank and bush, from the lowest gate of
the king&#8217;s kitchen-garden to the root of this
rose-tree. He looks a wise boy, and I hope he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
will keep the secret, or we shall have all the
west country here, dabbling in our fountain,
and leaving us no rest to either talk or sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fairyfoot listened in great astonishment,
but when the talk ceased and the songs began,
he thought it might be as well for him to follow
the ground-ivy, and see the Princess Maybloom,
not to speak of getting rid of Rough
Ruddy, the sickly sheep, and the crusty old
shepherd. It was a long journey; but he went
on, eating wild berries by day, sleeping in the
hollows of old trees by night, and never losing
sight of the ground-ivy, which led him to a
great city, and to a low old-fashioned gate
of the king&#8217;s kitchen-garden, which was
thought too mean for the scullions, and had
not been opened for seven years.</p>

<p>He climbed over, and walked through the
garden, till a white fawn came frisking by,
and he heard a soft voice saying sorrowfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, come back, my fawn! I cannot
run and play with you now, my feet have
grown so heavy&#8221;; and, looking round, he saw
the loveliest young princess in the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
dressed in snow-white, and wearing a wreath
of roses on her golden hair; but walking
slowly, as the great people did in Stumpinghame,
for her feet were as large as the best
of them.</p>

<p>After her came six young ladies, dressed in
white and walking slowly, for they could not
go before the princess; but Fairyfoot was
amazed to see that their feet were as small as
his own. At once he guessed that this must
be the Princess Maybloom, and made her a
bow, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Royal princess, I have heard of your
trouble because your feet have grown large;
in my country that&#8217;s all the fashion. For
seven years past I have been wondering to no
purpose what would make mine grow. But
I know of a certain fountain that will make
yours smaller and finer than ever they were,
if the king, your father, will give you leave
to come with me. You may be accompanied
by two of your maids that are the least given
to talking, and the most prudent officer in all
the king&#8217;s household; for it would grievously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
offend the fairies and the nightingales to make
that fountain known.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the princess heard this, she danced
for joy in spite of her large feet, and she and
her six maids brought Fairyfoot before the
king and queen, where they sat in their palace
hall, with all the courtiers paying their morning
compliments. At first the king would not
believe that there could be any use in this offer,
because so many great physicians had
failed to give any relief. The courtiers
laughed Fairyfoot to scorn, and he wished
himself safe in the forest again; but the queen
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray your majesty to notice what fine feet
this boy has. There may be some truth in
his story. For the sake of our only daughter,
I will choose two maids who talk the least
of all our train, and my chamberlain, who is
the most discreet officer in our household. Let
them go with the princess. Who knows but
our sorrow may be lessened?&#8221;</p>

<p>After some persuasion the king consented,
though all his councillors advised the contrary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
So the two silent maids, the discreet
chamberlain, and her fawn, which would not
stay behind, were sent with the princess Maybloom,
and they all set out after dinner. Fairyfoot
had hard work guiding them along the
track of the ground-ivy; but at last they
reached the grove of rose-trees and the spring
bordered with lilies.</p>

<p>The chamberlain washed&mdash;and though his
hair had been grey and his face wrinkled, the
young courtiers envied his beauty for years
after. The maids washed&mdash;and from that day
they were esteemed the fairest in all the palace.
Lastly, the princess washed also&mdash;it could
make her no fairer, but the moment her feet
touched the water they grew less, and when
she had washed and dried them three times,
they were as small and finely shaped as Fairyfoot&#8217;s
own. There was great joy among them,
but the boy said sorrowfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if there had been a well in the world
to make my feet large, my father and mother
would not have cast me off, nor sent me to
live among the shepherds.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;Cheer up!&#8221; said the Princess Maybloom.
&#8220;If you want large feet, there is a well in this
forest that will do it. Last summer-time I
came with my father and his foresters to see
a great cedar cut down, of which he meant
to make a money chest. While they were
busy with the cedar, I saw a bramble branch
covered with berries. Some were ripe and
some were green, but it was the longest bramble
that ever grew. For the sake of the berries,
I went on and on to its root, which grew
near a muddy-looking well, with banks of
dark green moss, in the deepest part of the
forest. The day was warm and dry, and my
feet were sore with the rough ground, so I
took off my scarlet shoes, and washed my feet
in the well; but as I washed they grew larger
every minute, and nothing could ever make
them less again. I have seen the bramble
this day; it is not far off, and as you have
shown me the Fair Fountain, I will show you
the Growing Well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up rose Fairyfoot and Princess Maybloom,
and went together till they found the bramble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and came to where its root grew, near the
muddy-looking well, with banks of dark moss
in the deepest dell of the forest. Fairyfoot
sat down to wash, but at that minute he heard
a sound of music, and knew it was the fairies
going to their dancing ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my feet grow large,&#8221; said the boy to
himself, &#8220;how shall I dance with them?&#8221; So,
rising quickly, he took the Princess Maybloom
by the hand. The fawn followed them; the
maids and the chamberlain followed it, and
all followed the music through the forest. At
last they came to the flowery green. Robin
Goodfellow welcomed the company for Fairyfoot&#8217;s
sake, and they danced from sunset till the
grey morning, and nobody was tired; but before
the lark sang, Robin Goodfellow took
them all safe home, as he used to take Fairyfoot.</p>

<p>There was great joy that day in the palace
because Princess Maybloom&#8217;s feet were made
small again. The king gave Fairyfoot all
manner of fine clothes and rich jewels; and
when they heard his wonderful story, he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the queen asked him to live with them and be
their son. In process of time Fairyfoot and
Princess Maybloom were married, and still
live happily. When they go to visit at Stumpinghame,
they always wash their feet in the
Growing Well, lest the royal family might
think them a disgrace, but when they come
back, they make haste to the Fair Fountain;
and the fairies and the nightingales are great
friends to them, as well as the maids and the
chamberlain, because they have told nobody
about it, and there is peace and quiet yet in
the grove of rose-trees. (Adapted.)</p>

<h3>FIRST STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Which Treats of a Mirror and of the
Splinters</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now,</span> then, let us begin. When we are at the
end of the story, we shall know more than we
know now; but to begin:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a wicked Sprite,
indeed, he was the most mischievous of all
sprites. One day he was in a very good humour,
for he had made a mirror with the
power of causing all that was good and beautiful,
when it was reflected therein, to look
poor and mean; but that which was good for
nothing and looked ugly, was shown magnified
and increased in ugliness. In this mirror the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled
spinach, and the best persons were turned into
frights, or appeared to stand on their heads;
their faces were so distorted that they were not
to be recognized; and if anyone had a mole,
you might be sure that it would be magnified
and spread over both nose and mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s glorious fun!&#8221; said the Sprite.</p>

<p>If a good thought passed through a man&#8217;s
mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and
the Sprite laughed heartily at his clever discovery.</p>

<p>All the little sprites who went to his school&mdash;for
he kept a sprite-school&mdash;told one another
that a miracle had happened; and that now
only, as they thought, it would be possible to
see how the world really looked. They ran
about with the mirror; and at last there was
not a land or a person who was not represented
distorted in the mirror. So then they thought
they would fly up to the sky, and have a joke
there. The higher they flew with the mirror,
the more terribly it grinned; they could hardly
hold it fast. Higher and higher still they flew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly,
the mirror shook so terribly with grinning that
it flew out of their hands and fell to the earth,
where it was dashed in a hundred million and
more pieces. And now it worked much more
evil than before; for some of these pieces were
hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they
flew about in a wide world, and when they got
into people&#8217;s eyes, there they stayed; and then
people saw everything perverted, or only had
an eye for that which was evil. This happened
because the very smallest bit had the
same power which the whole mirror had possessed.
Some persons even got a splinter in
their hearts, and then it made one shudder, for
their hearts became like lumps of ice. Some
of the broken pieces were so large that they
were used for window-panes, through which
one could not see one&#8217;s friends. Other pieces
were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair
when people put on their glasses to see
well and rightly. Then the wicked Sprite
laughed till he almost choked, for all this
tickled his fancy. The fine splinters still flew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
about in the air: and now we shall hear what
happened next.</p>


<h3>SECOND STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Little Boy and a Little Girl</i></p>

<p>In a large town, where there are so many
houses, and so many people, that there is no
room left for everybody to have a little garden,
and where, on this account, most persons
are obliged to content themselves with flowers
in pots, there lived two little children, who had
a garden somewhat larger than a flower-pot.
They were not brother and sister; but they
cared for each other as much as if they were.
Their parents lived exactly opposite. They
inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of
the one house joined that of the other, and the
gutter ran along the extreme end of it, there
was to each house a small window: one needed
only to step over the gutter to get from one
window to the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>The children&#8217;s parents had large wooden
boxes there, in which vegetables for the
kitchen were planted, and little rose-trees, besides;
there was a rose in each box, and they
grew splendidly. They now thought of placing
the boxes across the gutter, so that they
nearly reached from one window to the other,
and looked just like two walls of flowers. The
tendrils of the peas hung down over the boxes,
and the rose-trees shot up long branches, twined
around the windows, and then bent toward
each other: it was almost like a triumphal
arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were
very high, and the children knew that they
must not creep over them; so they often obtained
permission to get out of the windows
to each other, and to sit on their little stools
among the roses, where they could play delightfully.
In winter there was an end of this
pleasure. The windows were often frozen
over; but then they heated copper farthings
on the stove, and laid the hot farthings on the
window-pane, and then they had a capital
peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
each peeped a gentle, friendly eye&mdash;it was the
little boy and the little girl who were looking
out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In
summer, with one jump, they could get to each
other; but in winter they were obliged first to
go down the long stairs, and then up the long
stairs again: and out-of-doors there was quite
a snow-storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the white bees that are swarming,&#8221;
said Kay&#8217;s old grandmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the white bees choose a queen?&#8221; asked
the little boy; for he knew that the honey-bees
always have one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the grandmother, &#8220;she flies
where the swarm hangs in the thickest clusters.
She is the largest of all; and she can
never remain quietly on the earth, but goes up
again into the black clouds. Many a winter&#8217;s
night she flies through the streets of the town,
and peeps in at the windows; and they then
freeze in so wondrous a manner that they look
like flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have seen it,&#8221; said both the children;
and so they knew that it was true.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;Can the Snow-Queen come in?&#8221; said the
little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only let her come in!&#8221; said the little boy;
&#8220;then I&#8217;d put her on the stove, and she&#8217;d melt.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then his grandmother patted his head,
and told him other stories.</p>

<p>In the evening, when little Kay was at home,
and half undressed, he climbed upon the
chair by the window, and peeped out of the
little hole. A few snowflakes were falling,
and one, the largest of all, remained lying on
the edge of a flower-pot. The flake of snow
grew larger and larger; and, at last, it was like
a young lady, dressed in the finest white gauze,
made of a million little flakes, like stars. She
was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of
ice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived;
her eyes gazed fixedly, like two stars; but there
was neither quiet nor repose in them. She
nodded toward the window, and beckoned
with her hand. The little boy was frightened,
and jumped down from the chair; it seemed
to him as if, at the same moment, a large bird
flew past the window.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>The next day it was a sharp frost; and then
the spring came; the sun shone, the green
leaves appeared, the swallows built their
nests, the windows were opened, and the little
children again sat in their pretty garden, high
up on the leads at the top of the house.</p>

<p>That summer the roses flowered in wondrous
beauty. The little girl had learned a
hymn, in which there was something about
roses; and then she thought of her own flowers;
and she sang the verse to the little boy,
who then sang it with her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">The Christ-child is there the children to greet.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the children held each other by the hand,
kissed the roses, and looked up at the clear
sunshine. What lovely summer days those
were! How delightful to be out in the air,
near the fresh rosebushes, that seemed as if
they would never finish blossoming!</p>

<p>Kay and Gerda looked at the picture-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
full of beasts and of birds; and it was then&mdash;the
clock in the church-tower was just striking
five&mdash;that Kay said, &#8220;Oh, I feel such a sharp
pain in my heart; and now something has
flown into my eye!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl put her arms round his neck.
He winked his eyes: now there was nothing
to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is out now,&#8221; said he; but it was
not. It was just one of those pieces of glass
from the magic mirror that had flown into his
eye. Another piece had pierced his heart,
where it soon became like ice. It did not hurt
any longer, but there it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you crying for?&#8221; asked he. &#8220;You
look so ugly! There&#8217;s nothing the matter
with me. Ah!&#8221; said he at once, &#8220;that rose is
cankered! and, look, this one is quite crooked!
after all, these roses are very ugly! they are
just like the box they are planted in!&#8221; And
then he gave the box a good kick with his foot,
and pulled both the roses up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; cried the little girl;
and as he perceived her fright, he pulled up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
another rose, got in at the window, and hastened
away from dear little Gerda.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when she brought her picture-book,
he asked, &#8220;What horrid beasts have you
there?&#8221; And if his grandmother told him stories,
he always interrupted her; besides, if he
could manage it, he would get behind her, put
on her spectacles, and imitate her way of
speaking: he copied all her ways, and then
everybody laughed at him. He was soon able
to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in
the street. Everything that was peculiar and
displeasing in them,&mdash;that Kay knew how to
imitate; and at such times all the people said,
&#8220;The boy is certainly very clever!&#8221; But it
was the glass he had in his eye; the glass
that was sticking in his heart, which made him
tease even little Gerda, whose whole soul was
devoted to him.</p>

<p>His games now were quite different to what
they had formerly been, they were so very
knowing. One winter&#8217;s day, when the flakes
of snow were flying about, he spread the skirts
of his blue coat, and caught the snow as it fell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;Look through this glass, Gerda,&#8221; said he.
And every flake seemed larger, and appeared
like a magnificent flower, or a beautiful star:
it was splendid to look at!</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, how clever!&#8221; said Kay. &#8220;That&#8217;s
much more interesting than real flowers! They
are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in
them, if only they did not melt!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Kay came one
day with large gloves on, and his little sledge
at his back, and called right into Gerda&#8217;s ears,
&#8220;I have permission to go out into the square,
where the others are playing&#8221;; and off he was
in a moment.</p>

<p>There, in the market-place, some of the
boldest of the boys used to tie their sledges to
the carts as they passed by. In this way they
were pulled along, and got a good ride. It was
capital sport! Just as they were in the very
height of their amusement, a large sledge
passed by: it was painted white, and there was
someone in it wrapped up in a rough white
mantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on
his head. The sledge drove round the square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
twice, and Kay tied on his as quickly as he
could, and off he drove with it. On they went
quicker and quicker into the next street; and
the person who drove turned round to Kay, and
nodded to him in a friendly manner, just as if
they knew each other. Every time he was going
to untie his sledge the person nodded to
him, and then Kay sat quiet; and so on they
went till they came outside the gates of the
town. Then the snow began to fall so thickly
that the little boy could not see an arm&#8217;s length
before him, but still on he went; then suddenly,
he let go the string he held in his hand
in order to get loose from the sledge, but it
was of no use; still the little vehicle rushed on
with the quickness of the wind. He then cried
as loud as he could, but no one heard him; the
snow drifted and the sledge flew on, and sometimes
it gave a jerk as though they were driving
over hedges and ditches. He was quite
frightened, and he tried to repeat the Lord&#8217;s
Prayer; but in spite of his efforts he was able
only to remember the multiplication table.</p>

<p>The snowflakes grew larger and larger, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
at last they looked just like great white fowls.
Suddenly they flew on one side; the large
sledge stopped, and the person who drove rose
up. It was a lady. Her cloak and cap were of
snow. She was tall, of slender figure, and of
a dazzling whiteness. It was the Snow-Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have travelled fast,&#8221; said she; &#8220;but it
is terribly cold. Come under my bearskin.&#8221;
And she put him in the sledge beside her,
wrapped the fur round him, and he felt as
though he were sinking in a snow-wreath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you still cold?&#8221; asked she; and then
she kissed his forehead. Ah! it was colder
than ice; it penetrated to his very heart, which
was already almost a frozen lump; it seemed
to him as if he were about to die,&mdash;but a moment
more and it was quite congenial to him,
and he did not notice the cold that was
around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!&#8221; It
was the first thing he thought of. It was there,
tied to one of the white chickens, who flew
along with it on his back behind the large
sledge. The Snow-Queen kissed Kay once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
more, and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother,
and all whom he had left at his home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you shall have no more kisses,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;or else I should kiss you to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kay looked at her. She was very beautiful;
a more clever or a more lovely countenance
he could not fancy to himself; and she no
longer appeared of ice as before, when she sat
outside the window, and beckoned to him; in
his eyes she was perfect; he did not fear her
at all, and told her that he could calculate in
his head, and with fractions even; that he knew
the number of square miles there were in the
different countries, and how many inhabitants
they contained; and she smiled while he spoke.
It then seemed to him as if what he knew was
not enough, and he looked upwards in the
large, huge, empty space about him, and on
she flew with him; flew high over the black
clouds, while the storm moaned and whistled
as though it were singing some old tune. On
they flew over woods and lakes, over seas and
many lands; and beneath them the chilling
storm rushed fast, the wolves howled, the snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
crackled; above them flew large screaming
crows, but higher up appeared the moon, quite
large and bright; and it was on it that Kay
gazed during the long, long winter&#8217;s night,
while by day he slept at the feet of the Snow-Queen.</p>


<h3>THIRD STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Flower-garden at the Old Woman&#8217;s<br />
Who Understood Witchcraft</i></p>

<p>But what became of little Gerda when Kay
did not return? Where could he be? Nobody
knew. The boys said that they had
seen him tie his sledge to another large and
splendid one, which drove down the street and
out of the town. But they did not know where
he was. Many sad tears were shed, and little
Gerda wept long and bitterly; at last she said
he must be dead; that he had been drowned
in the river which flowed close to the town.
Oh, those were very long and dismal winter
evenings!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>At last spring came with its warm sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kay is dead and gone!&#8221; said little Gerda.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; said the Sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kay is dead and gone!&#8221; said she to the
Swallows.</p>

<p>&#8220;That we don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; said they; and at
last little Gerda did not think so any longer
either.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put on my red shoes,&#8221; said she one
morning; &#8220;Kay has never seen them, and then
I&#8217;ll go down to the river and ask there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was quite early: she kissed her old grandmother,
who was still asleep, put on her red
shoes, and went alone to the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true that you have taken my little
playfellow? I will make you a present of my
red shoes if you will give him back to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves
nodded in a strange manner; then she took off
her red shoes, the most precious things she
possessed, and threw them both into the river.
But they fell close to the bank, and the little
waves bore them immediately to land; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
as if the stream would not take what was dearest
to her; for in reality it had not taken little
Kay: but Gerda thought that she had not
thrown the shoes out far enough, so she clambered
into a boat which lay among the rushes,
went to the farthest end, and threw out the
shoes. But the boat was not fastened, and the
motion which she occasioned made it drift
from the shore. She observed this, and hastened
to get back; but before she could do so,
the boat was more than a yard from the land,
and was gliding quickly onward.</p>

<p>Little Gerda was very much frightened, and
began to cry; but no one heard her except the
Sparrows, and they could not carry her to
land; but they flew along the bank, and sang
as if to comfort her, &#8220;Here we are! here we
are!&#8221; The boat drifted with the stream, little
Gerda sat quite still without shoes, for they
were swimming behind the boat, but could not
reach it, because it went much faster than
they.</p>

<p>The banks on both sides were beautiful.
There were lovely flowers, venerable trees, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
slopes with sheep and cows, but there was not
a human being to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the river will carry me to little
Kay,&#8221; said she; and then she grew less sad.
She rose, and looked for many hours at the
beautiful green banks. Presently, she sailed
by a large cherry-orchard, where there was a
little cottage with curious red and blue windows;
it was thatched, and before it two
wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented
arms when anyone went past.</p>

<p>Gerda called to them, for she thought they
were alive; but they, of course, did not answer.
She came close to them, for the stream drifted
the boat quite near the land.</p>

<p>Gerda called still louder and then an old
woman leaning upon a crooked stick came out
of the cottage. She had a large, broad-brimmed
hat on, painted with the most splendid
flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little child!&#8221; said the old woman,
&#8220;how did you get upon the large, rapid river,
to be driven about so in the wide world!&#8221;
And then the old woman went into the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
caught hold of the boat with her crooked stick,
drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda
out. And Gerda was glad to be on dry land
again, but she was rather afraid of the strange
old woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;But come and tell me who you are, and
how you came here,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>And Gerda told her all; and the old woman
shook her head and said, &#8220;A-hem! a-hem!&#8221;
and when Gerda had told her everything, and
asked her if she had not seen little Kay, the
woman answered that he had not passed there,
but he no doubt would come; and she told
her not to be cast down, but to taste her cherries,
and look at her flowers, which were finer
than any in a picture-book, for each could tell
a whole story. She then took Gerda by the
hand, led her into the little cottage, and locked
the door.</p>

<p>The windows were very high up; the glass
was red, blue, and green, and the sunlight
shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of
colours. On the table stood the most exquisite
cherries, and Gerda ate as many as she chose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
for she had permission to do so. While she
was eating, the old woman combed her hair
with a golden comb, and her hair curled and
shone with a lovely golden colour around that
sweet little face, which was so round and so
like a rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often longed for such a dear little
girl,&#8221; said the old woman. &#8220;Now you shall
see how well we agree together;&#8221; and while
she combed little Gerda&#8217;s hair, the child forgot
her foster-brother Kay more and more,
for the old woman understood magic; but she
was no evil being, she only practised witchcraft
a little for her own amusement, and she
wished very much to keep little Gerda. She,
therefore, went out into the garden, stretched
out her crooked stick towards the rosebushes,
which, beautifully as they were growing, all
sank into the earth, and no one could tell
where they had stood. The old woman
feared that if Gerda should see the roses, she
would then think of her own, would remember
little Kay, and run away from her.</p>

<p>She now led Gerda into the flower-garden.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Oh, what odour and what loveliness was there!
Every flower that one could think of, and of
every season, stood there in fullest bloom; no
picture-book could be gayer or more beautiful.
Gerda jumped for joy, and played till
the sun set behind the tall cherry-tree; she then
had a pretty bed, with a red silken coverlet
filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and
had as pleasant dreams as ever a queen on her
wedding-day.</p>

<p>The next morning she went to play with the
flowers in the warm sunshine, and thus passed
away a day. Gerda knew every flower; and,
numerous as they were, it still seemed to
Gerda that one was wanting, though she did
not know which. One day, while she was
looking at the old woman&#8217;s hat which was
painted with flowers, the most beautiful of
them all seemed to her to be a rose. The old
woman had forgotten to take it from her hat
when she made the others vanish in the earth.
But so it is when one&#8217;s thoughts are not collected.
&#8220;What!&#8221; said Gerda, &#8220;are there no
roses here?&#8221; and she ran about amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
flower-beds, and looked, and looked, but there
was not one to be found. She then sat down
and wept. Her hot tears fell just where a rosebush
had sunk; and where her warm tears
watered the ground, the rosebush shot up suddenly
as fresh and blooming as when it had
been swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses,
thought of her own dear roses at home, and
with them of little Kay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how long I have stayed!&#8221; said the little
girl. &#8220;I intended to look for Kay! Don&#8217;t
you know where he is?&#8221; asked she of the roses.
&#8220;Do you think he is dead and gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead he certainly is not,&#8221; said the roses.
&#8220;We have been in the earth where all the dead
are, but Kay is not there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many thanks!&#8221; said little Gerda; and she
went to the other flowers, looked into their
cups, and asked, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know where little
Kay is?&#8221; But every flower stood in the
sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy-tale or
its own story; and they all told her very
many things; but not one knew anything of
Kay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>Then Gerda questioned the little snowdrop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between the trees a long board is hanging&mdash;it
is a swing. Two little girls are sitting
in it, and are swinging themselves backward
and forward: their frocks are as white as
snow, and long green silk ribbons flutter from
their bonnets. Their brother, who is older
than they are, stands up in the swing; he twines
his arms round the cords to hold himself fast,
for in one hand he has a little cup, and in the
other a clay pipe. He is blowing soap-bubbles.
The swing moves. The little black dog, as
light as a soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind
legs to try to get into the swing. It moves, the
dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They
tease him; the bubble bursts! A swing&mdash;a
bursting bubble&mdash;such is my song!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you relate may be very pretty, but
you tell it so sorrowfully, and you don&#8217;t even
mention little Kay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Gerda went to the buttercups, that
looked forth from among the shining green
leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a little bright sun!&#8221; said Gerda.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
&#8220;Tell me if you know where I can find my
playfellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the buttercups shone brightly, and
looked again at Gerda. What song could
they sing? It was one that said nothing about
Kay either.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a small court the bright sun was shining
in the first days of spring. The beams glided
down the white walls of a neighbour&#8217;s house,
and close by the fresh yellow flowers were
growing, shining like gold in the warm sun-rays.
An old grandmother was sitting in the
air, with her granddaughter, the poor and
lovely servant just come for a short visit. She
knows her grandmother. There was gold,
pure, virgin gold in that blessed kiss. There,
that is our little story,&#8221; said the buttercups.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor old grandmother!&#8221; sighed Gerda.
&#8220;Yes, she is longing for me, no doubt; she is
sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay.
But I will soon come home, and then I will
bring Kay with me. It is of no use asking the
flowers; they know only their own old rhymes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and can tell me nothing.&#8221; And then off she
ran to the further end of the garden.</p>

<p>The gate was locked, but she shook the
rusted bolt till it was loosened, and the gate
opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted
into the wide world. She looked round her
thrice, but no one followed her. At last she
could run no longer; she sat down on a large
stone, and when she looked about her, she saw
that the summer had passed; it was late in the
autumn, but that one could not remark in the
beautiful garden, where there was always sunshine,
and where there were flowers the whole
year round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, how long I have stayed!&#8221; said
Gerda. &#8220;Autumn is come. I must not rest
any longer.&#8221; And she got up to continue her
journey.</p>

<p>Oh, how tender and weary her little feet
were! All around it looked so cold and raw;
the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and
the fog dripped from them like water; one
leaf fell after the other; the sloes only stood
full of fruit which set one&#8217;s teeth on edge. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
how dark and comfortless it was in the dreary
world!</p>


<h3>FOURTH STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Prince and Princess</i></p>

<p>Gerda was obliged to rest herself again,
when, exactly opposite to her, a large raven
came hopping over the white snow. He had
long been looking at Gerda and shaking his
head; and now he said, &#8220;Caw! caw! Good
day! good day!&#8221; He could not say it better;
but he felt a sympathy for the little girl, and
asked her where she was going all alone. The
world &#8220;alone&#8221; Gerda understood quite well,
and felt how much was expressed by it; so she
told the Raven her whole history, and asked
if he had not seen Kay.</p>

<p>The Raven nodded very gravely, and said,
&#8220;It may be&mdash;it may be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! do you really think so?&#8221; cried the
little girl; and she nearly squeezed the Raven
to death, so much did she kiss him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;Gently, gently,&#8221; said the Raven. &#8220;I think
I know; I think that it may be little Kay. But
now he has forgotten you for the Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he live with a princess?&#8221; asked
Gerda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;listen,&#8221; said the Raven; &#8220;but it will
be difficult for me to speak your language. If
you understand the Raven language, I can tell
you better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have not learnt it,&#8221; said Gerda; &#8220;but
my grandmother understands it. I wish I had
learnt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; said the Raven; &#8220;I will tell
you as well as I can; however, it will be bad
enough.&#8221; And then he told all he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the kingdom where we now are there
lives a princess who is extraordinarily clever;
for she has read all the newspapers in the
whole world, and has forgotten them again,&mdash;so
clever is she. She was lately, it is said, sitting
on her throne,&mdash;which is not so very
amusing, after all,&mdash;when she began humming
an old tune, and it was just &#8216;Oh, why should
I not be married?&#8217; &#8216;That song is not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
its meaning,&#8217; said she, and then she was determined
to marry; but she would have a husband
who knew how to give an answer when
he was spoken to,&mdash;not one who looked only as
if he were a great personage, for that is so
tiresome. She then had all the ladies of the
court drummed together; and when they heard
her intention, all were well pleased, and said,
&#8216;We are quite glad to hear it; it is the very
thing we were thinking of.&#8217; You may believe
every word I say,&#8221; said the Raven, &#8220;for I have
a tame sweetheart that hops about in the palace
quite free, and it was she who told me all
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;The newspapers appeared forthwith with
a border of hearts and the initials of the Princess;
and therein you might read that every
good-looking young man was at liberty to
come to the palace and speak to the Princess;
and he who spoke in such wise as showed he
felt himself at home there, that one the Princess
would choose for her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes,&#8221; said the Raven, &#8220;you may believe
it; it is as true as I am sitting here. People<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
came in crowds; there was a crush and a
hurry, but no one was successful either on the
first or second day. They could all talk well
enough when they were out in the street; but
as soon as they came inside the palace-gates,
and saw the guard richly dressed in silver, and
the lackeys in gold, on the staircase, and the
large, illuminated saloons, then they were
abashed; and when they stood before the
throne on which the Princess was sitting, all
they could do was to repeat the last word they
had uttered, and to hear it again did not interest
her very much. It was just as if the people
within were under a charm, and had fallen
into a trance till they came out again into the
street; for then,&mdash;yes, then they could chatter
enough. There was a whole row of them
standing from the town-gates to the palace. I
was there myself to look,&#8221; said the Raven.
&#8220;They grew hungry and thirsty: but from the
palace they got nothing whatever, not even a
glass of water. Some of the cleverest, it is
true, had taken bread and butter with them;
but none shared it with his neighbour, for each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
thought, &#8216;Let him look hungry, and then the
Princess won&#8217;t have him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Kay&mdash;little Kay,&#8221; said Gerda, &#8220;when
did he come? Was he among the number?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience, patience; we are just come to
him. It was on the third day, when a little
personage, without horse or equipage, came
marching right boldly up to the palace; his
eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful long
hair, but his clothes were very shabby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Kay,&#8221; cried Gerda, with a voice
of delight. &#8220;Oh, now I&#8217;ve found him!&#8221; and
she clapped her hands for joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had a little knapsack at his back,&#8221; said
the Raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that was certainly his sledge,&#8221; said
Gerda; &#8220;for when he went away he took his
sledge with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; said the Raven; &#8220;I did not
examine him so minutely: but I know from
my tame sweetheart that when he came into
the courtyard of the palace, and saw the bodyguard
in silver, the lackeys on the staircase, he
was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
to them, &#8216;It must be very tiresome to stand on
the stairs; for my part, I shall go in.&#8217; All the
rooms were ablaze with light; privy-councilors
and excellencies were walking about barefoot,
and bearing gold vases; it was enough to
make anyone feel uncomfortable. His boots
creaked, too, so loudly; but still he was not at
all afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Kay, for certain,&#8221; said Gerda. &#8220;I
know he had on new boots; I have heard them
creaking in grandmamma&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they creaked,&#8221; said the Raven. &#8220;And
on he went boldly up to the Princess, who was
sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.
All the ladies of the court, with their attendants
and attendants&#8217; attendants, and all the
cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen&#8217;s
gentlemen, stood round; and the nearer
they stood to the door, the prouder they looked.
It was hardly possible to look at the gentlemen&#8217;s
gentleman, so very haughtily did he
stand in the doorway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been terrible,&#8221; said little
Gerda. &#8220;And did Kay get the Princess?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;Were I not a Raven, I should have taken
the Princess myself, although I am promised.
It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I
talk Raven language; this I learned from my
tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely behaved;
he had not come to woo the Princess,
but only to hear her wisdom. She pleased
him, and he pleased her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay,&#8221; said
Gerda. &#8220;He was so clever; he could reckon
fractions in his head. Oh, won&#8217;t you take me
to the palace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very easily said,&#8221; answered the
Raven. &#8220;But how are we to manage it? I&#8217;ll
speak to my tame sweetheart about it; she
must advise us; for so much I must tell you,
such a little girl as you are will never get permission
to enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I shall,&#8221; said Gerda; &#8220;when Kay
hears that I am here, he will come out directly
to fetch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait for me here on these steps,&#8221; said the
Raven. He moved his head backward and
forward, and flew away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>The evening was closing in when the Raven
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! caw!&#8221; said he. &#8220;She sends you her
compliments; and here is a roll for you. She
took it out of the kitchen, where there is bread
enough. You are hungry, no doubt. It is not
possible for you to enter the palace, for you
are barefoot; the guards in silver and the lackeys
in gold would not allow it; but do not cry,
you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows
a little back stair that leads to the bedroom,
and she knows where she can find the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they went into the garden by the large
avenue, where one leaf after another was falling;
and when the lights in the palace had
all gradually disappeared, the Raven led little
Gerda to the back door, which stood half
open. Oh, how Gerda&#8217;s heart beat with longing!
It was just as if she had been about to
do something wrong; and yet she only wanted
to know if little Kay was there. Yes, he must
be there. She called to mind his intelligent
eyes and his long hair so vividly, she could
quite see him as he used to laugh when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
were sitting under the roses at home. &#8220;He
will, no doubt, be glad to see you,&mdash;to hear
what a long way you have come for his sake;
to know how unhappy all at home were when
he did not come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her heart thrilled with fear and joy.</p>

<p>They were now on the stairs. A single lamp
was burning there; and on the floor stood the
tame Raven, turning her head on every side
and looking at Gerda, who bowed as her
grandmother had taught her to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;My intended has told me so much good of
you, my dear young lady,&#8221; said the tame
Raven. &#8220;Your tale is very affecting. If you
will take the lamp, I will go before. We will
go straight on, for we shall meet no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is somebody just behind us,&#8221;
said Gerda; and something rushed past: it was
like shadowy figures on the wall; horses with
flowing manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies
and gentlemen on horseback.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are only dreams,&#8221; said the Raven.
&#8220;They come to fetch the thoughts of the high
personages to the chase: &#8217;tis well, for now you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
can look at them in their beds quite safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>They now entered the first room, which was
of rose-coloured satin, embroidered with flowers.
Here the dreams were rushing past, but
they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could
not see the high personages. One hall was
more magnificent than the other; and at last
they came to a bedroom. The ceiling of the
room was like a large palm-tree, with leaves
of costly glass; and in the middle of the floor
two beds shaped like lilies hung from thick,
golden stems. One was white, and in this lay
the Princess: the other was red, and it was
there that Gerda was to look for little Kay.
She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw
a brown neck&mdash;Oh, that was Kay! She called
him quite loud by name, held the lamp toward
him, he awoke, turned his head, and&mdash;it was
not little Kay!</p>

<p>The Prince was only like him about the
neck; but he was young and handsome. And
out of the white lily leaves the Princess
peeped, too, and asked what was the matter.
Then little Gerda cried and told her her whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
history, and all that the Ravens had done for
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little thing!&#8221; said the Prince and the
Princess. They praised the Ravens very
much, and told them they were not at all angry
with them, but they were not to do so again.
However, they should have a reward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you fly about here at liberty,&#8221; asked
the Princess; &#8220;or would you like to have a
fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the
broken bits from the kitchen?&#8221;</p>

<p>And both the Ravens nodded, and begged
for a fixed appointment; for they thought of
their old age, and said, &#8220;It was a good thing to
have a provision for their old days.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep
in his bed, and more than this he could not do.
She folded her little hands, and thought, &#8220;How
kind all are to me, people and animals as
well,&#8221; and she then fell asleep and slept
soundly. All the dreams flew in again, and
they now looked like the angels; they drew a
little sledge, in which little Kay sat and
nodded his head; but the whole was only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
dream, and therefore it all vanished as soon as
she awoke.</p>

<p>The next day she was dressed from head to
foot in silk and velvet. They offered to let her
stay at the palace, and lead a happy life; but
she begged to have a little carriage with a
horse in front, and for a small pair of shoes:
then, she said, she would again go forth in the
wide world and look for Kay.</p>

<p>Shoes and a muff were given her; she was
dressed very nicely, too; and when she was
about to set off, a new carriage stopped before
the door. It was of pure gold, and the arms of
the Prince and Princess shone like a star upon
it; the coachman, the footman, and the outriders,
for outriders were there, too, all wore
golden crowns. The Prince and the Princess
assisted her into the carriage themselves, and
wished her all success. The Raven of the
woods, who was now married, accompanied
her for the first three miles. He sat beside
Gerda, for he could not bear riding backward.
The other Raven stood in the doorway;
and flapped her wings; she could not accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
Gerda, because she suffered from headache
since she had a fixed appointment and ate
so much. The carriage was lined inside with
sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and
gingerbread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell! farewell!&#8221; cried Prince and
Princess; and Gerda wept, and the Raven
wept. Thus passed the first three miles; and
then the Raven bade her farewell, and this
was the most painful separation of all. He
perched upon a tree, and flapped his black
wings as long as he could see the coach.</p>


<h3>FIFTH STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Little Robber-Maiden</i></p>

<p>Now Gerda was driven through a gloomy
forest, but the coach shone like a torch, and
it dazzled the eyes of some robbers who were
in the woods so that they could not bear to
look at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis gold! &#8217;Tis gold!&#8221; cried they; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
they rushed forward, seized the horses,
knocked down the little postilion, the coachman,
and the servants, and pulled little Gerda
out of the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;How plump, how beautiful she is! She
must have been fed on nut-kernels,&#8221; said an
old robber-woman, who had a long, scrubby
beard, and bushy eyebrows that hung down
over her eyes. &#8220;She will taste as good as a
fatted lamb!&#8221; And then she drew out a knife,
the blade of which shone so that it was quite
dreadful to behold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her alone,&#8221; called out a little robber-child.
&#8220;She will give me her muff, and her
pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have a ride in her carriage,&#8221; said
the little robber-maiden. She would have
her will, for she was very spoiled, and very
headstrong. She and Gerda got in; and then
away they drove over the stumps of felled
trees, deeper and deeper into the woods. The
little robber-maiden was as tall as Gerda, but
stronger, broader-shouldered, and of dark
complexion; her eyes were quite black. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
embraced little Gerda, and said, &#8220;They shall
not kill you as long as I am not displeased
with you. You are, doubtless, a princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said little Gerda, who then related
all that had happened to her, and how much
she cared about little Kay.</p>

<p>The little robber-maiden looked at her with
a serious air, nodded her head slightly, and
said, &#8220;They shall not kill you, even if I am
angry with you: then I will do it myself;&#8221; and
she dried Gerda&#8217;s eyes, and put both her hands
in the handsome muff, which was so soft and
warm.</p>

<p>At length the carriage stopped. They were
in the midst of the courtyard of a robber&#8217;s castle.
It was full of cracks from top to bottom;
and out of the openings magpies and rooks
were flying; and the great bulldogs, each of
which looked as if he could swallow a man,
jumped up, but they did not bark, for that was
forbidden.</p>

<p>In the midst of the large, old, smoking hall
burnt a great fire on the stone floor. The
smoke disappeared under the stones, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
to seek its own egress. In an immense cauldron
soup was boiling; and rabbits and hares
were being roasted on a spit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall sleep with me to-night, with my
little animals,&#8221; said the little robber-maiden.
They had something to eat and drink; and then
went into a corner, where straw and carpets
were lying. Beside them, on perches, sat
nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly,
but yet they moved a little when the
robber-maiden came. &#8220;They are all mine,&#8221;
said she, at the same time seizing one that was
next to her by the legs, and shaking it so that
its wings fluttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss it!&#8221; cried the little girl, flapping the
pigeon in Gerda&#8217;s face. &#8220;There are a lot of
them,&#8221; continued she, pointing to a hole high
up in the wall. &#8220;They would all fly away immediately,
if they were not well fastened in.
And here is my dear old Bac.&#8221; She laid hold
of the horns of a reindeer, that had a bright
copper ring round its neck, and was tethered
to the spot. &#8220;We are obliged to lock this fellow
in, too, or he would make his escape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Every evening I tickle his neck with my sharp
knife, which he is very much afraid of!&#8221; and
the little girl drew forth a long knife from a
crack in the wall, and let it glide gently across
the reindeer&#8217;s neck. The poor animal began
to kick and the girl laughed, and pulled Gerda
into bed with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you intend to keep your knife while
you sleep?&#8221; asked Gerda, looking at it rather
fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always sleep with the knife,&#8221; said the little
robber-maiden: &#8220;there is no knowing what
may happen. But tell me now, once more, all
about little Kay; and why you have started off
in the wide world alone.&#8221; And Gerda related
all, from the very beginning. The little robber-maiden
wound her arm round Gerda&#8217;s
neck, held the knife in the other hand, and
snored so loud that everybody could hear her.
But Gerda could not close her eyes, not knowing
whether she was to live or die. The robbers
sat round the fire, and the old robber-woman
jumped about so, that it was dreadful
for Gerda to see her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Then the wood-pigeons said, &#8220;Coo! coo! we
have seen little Kay! A white hen carries his
sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the
Snow-Queen, which passed right over the forest
as we lay in our nests. She blew upon us
young ones, and all died except we two. Coo!
coo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that you say up there?&#8221; cried little
Gerda. &#8220;Where did the Snow-Queen go to?
Do you know anything about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there
are always snow and ice there. Only ask the
Reindeer, who is tethered here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, ice and snow indeed! There it is
glorious and beautiful!&#8221; said the Reindeer.
&#8220;One can spring about in the large, shining
valleys! The Snow-Queen has her summer-tent
there; but her fixed abode is high up towards
the North Pole, on the island called
Spitzbergen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Kay! poor little Kay!&#8221; sighed Gerda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you choose to be quiet?&#8221; said the robber-maiden.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, I shall make
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>In the morning Gerda told her all that the
wood-pigeons had said; and the little maiden
looked very serious, but she nodded her head,
and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s no matter&mdash;that&#8217;s no matter.
Do you know where Lapland lies?&#8221; asked
she of the Reindeer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who should know better than I?&#8221; said the
animal; and his eyes rolled in his head. &#8220;I
was born and bred there; there I leapt about
on the fields of snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said the robber-maiden to Gerda.
&#8220;You see that the men are gone; but my
mother is still here, and will remain. As soon
as she sleeps a little I will do something for
you.&#8221; She now jumped out of bed, flew to her
mother; and with her arms round her neck
said, &#8220;Good-morning, you old stupid! good-morning.&#8221;
And her mother in return took
hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red
and blue,&mdash;and all this was out of pure
love.</p>

<p>When the mother had taken a sup, and was
having a nap, the little robber-maiden went
to the Reindeer, and said, &#8220;I should very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
like to give you still many a tickling with a
sharp knife, for then you are so amusing; however,
I will untether you, and help you out,
so that you may get back to Lapland. But you
must make good use of your legs; and take this
little girl for me to the palace of the Snow-Queen,
where her playfellow is. You have
heard, I suppose, all she said; for she spoke
loud enough, and you were listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Reindeer gave a bound for joy. The
robber-maiden lifted up little Gerda, and took
the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer&#8217;s
back; she even gave her a small cushion
to sit on. &#8220;Here are your worsted leggins, for
it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for
myself, for it is so very pretty. But I do not
wish you to be cold. Here is a pair of lined
gloves belonging to my mother; they will just
reach up to your elbow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Gerda wept for joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to see you fretting,&#8221; said the
little robber-maiden. &#8220;This is just the time
when you ought to look pleased. Here are two
loaves and a ham for you, so now you won&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
starve.&#8221; The bread and the meat were fastened
to the Reindeer&#8217;s back; the little maiden
opened the door, called in all the dogs, and
then with her knife cut the rope that fastened
the animal, and said to him, &#8220;Now off with
you; but take good care of the little girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Gerda stretched out her hands with the
large, wadded gloves toward the robber-maiden,
and said, &#8220;Farewell!&#8221; and the Reindeer
flew on over bush and bramble, through
the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast
as he could go.</p>


<h3>SIXTH STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Lapland Woman and the Finland Woman</i></p>

<p>Suddenly they stopped before a little
house which looked very miserable: the roof
reached to the ground; and the door was so
low, that the family was obliged to creep on
all fours when they went in or out. Nobody
was at home except an old Lapland woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
who was dressing fish by the light of an oil
lamp. And the Reindeer told her the whole
of Gerda&#8217;s history, but first of all, his own;
for that seemed to him of much greater importance.
Gerda was so chilled that she could
not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing,&#8221; said the Lapland woman,
&#8220;you have far to run still. You have more
than a hundred miles to go before you get to
Finland; there the Snow-Queen has her country-house,
and burns blue lights every evening.
I will give you a few words from me,
which I will write on a dried fish, for paper I
have none. This you can take with you to the
Finland woman, and she will be able to give
you more information than I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Gerda had warmed herself, and had
eaten and drunk, the Lapland woman wrote a
few words on a dried fish, begged Gerda to
take care of them, put her on the Reindeer,
bound her fast, and away sprang the animal.
The most charming blue lights burned the
whole night in the sky, and at last they came
to Finland. They knocked at the chimney of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
the Finland woman; for as to a door, she had
none.</p>

<p>There was such a heat inside that the Finland
woman herself went about almost naked.
She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately
loosened little Gerda&#8217;s clothes, pulled off
her thick gloves and boots; for otherwise the
heat would have been too great; and after
laying a piece of ice on the Reindeer&#8217;s head,
read what was written on the fishskin. She
read it three times; she then knew it by heart;
so she put the fish into the cupboard&mdash;for it
might very well be eaten, and she never threw
anything away.</p>

<p>Then the Reindeer related his own story
first, and afterwards that of little Gerda; and
the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so clever,&#8221; said the Reindeer: &#8220;you
can, I know, twist all the winds of the world
together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one
knot, then he has a good wind; if a second,
then it blows pretty stiffly; if he undoes the
third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
are upturned. Will you give the little
maiden a potion, that she may possess the
strength of twelve men, and be able to conquer
the Snow-Queen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The strength of twelve men!&#8221; said the Finland
woman; &#8220;much good that would be!&#8221;
Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a
large skin rolled up. When she had unrolled
it, strange characters were to be seen written
thereon; and the Finland woman read at such
a rate, that the perspiration trickled down her
forehead. But the Reindeer begged so hard
for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so imploringly
with tearful eyes at the Finland woman,
that she winked and drew the Reindeer aside
into a corner, where they whispered together,
while the animal got some fresh ice put on his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true little Kay is at the Snow-Queen&#8217;s
and finds everything there quite to his taste;
and he thinks it the very best place in the
world: but the reason of that is, he has a splinter
of glass in his eye and in his heart. These
must be gotten out first; otherwise he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
never go back to mankind, and the Snow-Queen
will always retain her power over
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can give little Gerda nothing to
take which will endue her with power over the
whole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can give her no more power than what
she has already. Don&#8217;t you see how great it is?
Don&#8217;t you see how men and animals are forced
to serve her; how well she gets through the
world barefooted? She must not hear of her
power from us: that power lies in her heart,
because she is a sweet and innocent child! If
she cannot get to the Snow-Queen by herself,
and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help
her. Two miles hence the garden of the Snow-Queen
begins; thither you may carry the little
girl. Set her down by the large bush with red
berries, standing in the snow; don&#8217;t stay talking,
but hasten back as fast as possible.&#8221; And
now the Finland woman placed little Gerda
on the Reindeer&#8217;s back, and off he ran with all
imaginable speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
brought my gloves!&#8221; cried little Gerda. She
remarked she was without them from the cutting
frost; but the Reindeer dared not stand
still; on he ran till he came to the great bush
with the red berries; and there he set Gerda
down, kissed her mouth, while large, bright
tears flowed from the animal&#8217;s eyes, and
then back he went as fast as possible. There
stood poor Gerda now, without shoes or
gloves, in the very middle of dreadful, icy
Finland.</p>

<p>She ran on as fast as she could. There then
came a whole regiment of snowflakes, but they
did not fall from above, and they were quite
bright and shining from the Aurora Borealis.
The flakes ran along the ground, and the
nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda
well remembered how large and strange the
snowflakes appeared when she once saw them
through a magnifying-glass; but now they
were large and terrific in another manner&mdash;they
were all alive. They were the outposts of
the Snow-Queen. They had the most wondrous
shapes; some looked like large, ugly porcupines;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
others like snakes knotted together,
with their heads sticking out; and others,
again, like small, fat bears, with the hair standing
on end: all were of dazzling whiteness&mdash;all
were living snowflakes.</p>

<p>The cold was so intense that little Gerda
could see her own breath, which came like
smoke out of her mouth. It grew thicker and
thicker, and took the form of little angels, that
grew more and more when they touched the
earth. All had helmets on their heads, and
carried lances and shields in their hands.
They increased in numbers; and soon Gerda
was surrounded by a host of them. They
pierced the frightful snowflakes with their
spears, so that they flew into a thousand pieces;
and little Gerda walked on bravely and in security.
The angels patted her hands and feet;
and then she felt the cold less, and went on
quickly towards the palace of the Snow-Queen.</p>

<p>But now we shall see how Kay fared. He
never thought of Gerda, and least of all that
she was standing before the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>


<h3>SEVENTH STORY</h3>

<p class="center"><i>What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow-Queen,<br />
and What Happened Afterward</i></p>

<p>The walls of the palace were of driving
snow, and the windows and doors of cutting
winds. There were more than a hundred halls
there, according as the snow was driven by the
winds. The largest was many miles in extent;
all were lighted up by the powerful
Aurora Borealis, and all were large, empty,
icy cold, and resplendent! Mirth never
reigned there; there was never even a little
ball for the bears, with the storm of music,
while the polar bears went on their hind-legs
and showed off their steps. Never a little tea-party
of white young lady foxes; vast, cold,
and empty were the halls of the Snow-Queen.
The northern lights shone with such precision
that one could tell exactly when they were at
their highest or lowest degree of brightness.
In the middle of the empty, endless hall of
snow was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
thousand pieces, but each piece was so like the
other, that it seemed the work of a cunning
artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the
Snow-Queen when she was at home. But just
now she had gone away in a far distant
land.</p>

<p>Little Kay was quite blue, yes, nearly black,
with cold; but he did not observe it, for she
had kissed away all feeling of cold from his
body, and his heart was a lump of ice. He was
dragging along some pointed, flat pieces of ice,
which he laid together in all possible ways, for
he wanted to make something with them; just
as we have little flat pieces of wood to make
geometrical figures with, called the Chinese
Puzzle. Kay made all sorts of figures, the
most complicated, for it was an ice-puzzle for
the understanding. In his eyes the figures
were extraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost
importance; for the bit of glass which
was in his eye caused this. He found whole
figures which represented a written word; but
he never could manage to represent just the
word he wanted&mdash;that word was &#8220;Eternity&#8221;;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
and the Snow-Queen had said, &#8220;If you can
discover that figure, you shall be your own
master, and I will make you a present of the
whole world and a pair of new skates.&#8221; But
he could not find it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going now to the warm lands,&#8221; said
the Snow-Queen. &#8220;I must have a look down
into the black cauldrons.&#8221; It was the volcanoes
Vesuvius and Etna that she meant. &#8220;I
will just give them a coating of white, for that
is as it ought to be; besides, it is good for the
oranges and the grapes.&#8221; And then away she
flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty
halls of ice that were miles long, and looked at
the blocks of ice. There he sat quite benumbed
and motionless; one would have imagined he
was frozen to death.</p>

<p>Suddenly little Gerda stepped through the
great portal into the palace. The gate was
formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated
her evening prayer, and the winds were laid as
though they slept; and the little maiden entered
the vast, empty, cold halls. There she
beheld Kay: she recognized him, flew to embrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
him, and cried out, her arms firmly holding
him the while, &#8220;Kay, sweet little Kay!
Have I then found you at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he sat quite still, benumbed and cold.
Then little Gerda shed burning tears; and they
fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his heart,
they thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed
the splinters of the looking-glass; he looked at
her, and she sang the hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">The Christ-child is there the children to greet.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so
much that the splinter rolled out of his eye,
and he recognized her, and shouted, &#8220;Gerda,
sweet little Gerda! where have you been so
long? And where have I been?&#8221; He looked
round him, &#8220;How cold it is here!&#8221; said he:
&#8220;how empty and cold!&#8221; And he held fast by
Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy. It was
so beautiful, that even the blocks of ice danced
about for joy; and when they were tired and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
laid themselves down, they formed exactly the
letters which the Snow-Queen had told him
to find out; so now he was his own master, and
he would have the whole world and a pair of
new skates into the bargain.</p>

<p>Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite
blooming; she kissed his eyes, and they shone
like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and
he was again well and merry. The Snow-Queen
might come back as soon as she liked;
there stood his discharge written in resplendent
masses of ice.</p>

<p>They took each other by the hands, and wandered
forth out of the large hall; they talked
of their old grandmother, and of the roses
upon the roof; and wherever they went, the
winds ceased raging, and the sun burst forth.
And when they reached the bush with the red
berries, they found the Reindeer waiting for
them. He had brought another, a young one,
with him, whose udder was filled with milk,
which he gave to the little ones, and kissed
their lips. They then carried Kay and Gerda,&mdash;first
to the Finland woman, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
warmed themselves in the warm room, and
learned what they were to do on their journey
home; and then they went to the Lapland
woman, who made some new clothes for them
and repaired their sledges.</p>

<p>The Reindeer and the young hind leaped
along beside them, and accompanied them to
the boundary of the country. Here the first
vegetation peeped forth; here Kay and Gerda
took leave of the Lapland woman. &#8220;Farewell!
farewell!&#8221; said they all. And the first green
buds appeared, the first little birds began to
twitter; and out of the wood came, riding on
a magnificent horse which Gerda knew (it was
one of the leaders in the golden carriage), a
young damsel with a bright red cap on her
head, and armed with pistols. It was the little
robber-maiden, who, tired of being at home,
had determined to make a journey to the
north; and afterwards in another direction,
if that did not please her. She recognized
Gerda immediately, and Gerda knew her, too.
It was a joyful meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fine fellow for tramping about,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
said she to little Kay; &#8220;I should like to know
whether you deserve that one should run from
one end of the world to the other for your
sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gerda patted her cheeks, and inquired
for the Prince and Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are gone abroad,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Raven?&#8221; asked little Gerda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the Raven is dead,&#8221; answered she.
&#8220;His tame sweetheart is a widow, and wears a
bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments
most piteously, but it&#8217;s all mere talk and
stuff! Now tell me what you&#8217;ve been doing,
and how you managed to catch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Gerda and Kay both told her their
story.</p>

<p>And &#8220;Snip, snap, snorum!&#8221; said the robber-maiden;
and she took the hands of each, and
promised that if she should some day pass
through the town where they lived, she would
come and visit them; and then away she rode.
Kay and Gerda took each other&#8217;s hand: it was
lovely spring weather, with abundance of flowers
and of verdure. The church-bells rang,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and the children recognized the high towers,
and the large town; it was that in which they
dwelt. They entered, and hastened up to their
grandmother&#8217;s room, where everything was
standing as formerly. The clock said, &#8220;Tick!
tock!&#8221; and the finger moved round; but as they
entered, they remarked that they were now
grown up. The roses on the roof hung blooming
in at the open window; there stood the little
children&#8217;s chairs, and Kay and Gerda sat
down on them, holding each other by the hand;
they both had forgotten the cold, empty splendour
of the Snow-Queen, as though it had been
a dream. The grandmother sat in the bright
sunshine, and read aloud from the Bible: &#8220;Unless
ye become as little children, ye cannot enter
the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Kay and Gerda looked in each other&#8217;s
eyes, and all at once they understood the old
hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">A MERRY TALE OF THE KING AND<br />
THE COBBLER</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> the custom of King Henry the Eighth
to disguise himself and walk late in the night
into the city of London, to observe how the
constables, and watchmen performed their
duty, not only in guarding the city gates, but
also, in diligently watching the inner part of
the city, to observe what went on in the streets.
This he did oftimes returning home to Whitehall
early in the morning without its being
discovered who he was. Now, on returning
home through the Strand he often took notice
of a certain cobbler who was always up at
work, whistling and singing every morning.
So, resolving to see him, the king knocked off
the heel of his shoe, by hitting it against a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
stone. Having so done he bounced against
the stall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; cried the cobbler opening
his stall door. The king asked him if he could
fit on his heel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that I can,&#8221; said the cobbler. &#8220;So sit
thee down and I will do it for thee straightway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cobbler laid aside his awls and old
shoes to make room for the king to sit by him.
The king was hardly able to keep from laughing
at the cobbler&#8217;s manner. He then asked
him, &#8220;Is there not a house near where I can
get a cup of good ale, and the people up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the cobbler, &#8220;there is an inn
over the way, where I think the folks are up,
for carriers go from there very early every
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that the king borrowed an old shoe
of the cobbler and went with him over to the
inn, desiring him to bring his shoe over there,
as soon as he had mended it. The cobbler
promised that he would; so making as much
haste as he could, he carried it over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
king saying, &#8220;Honest blade, here is thy shoe.
I&#8217;ll warrant thee, the heel will not come off
again in haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;as thou art an honest,
merry fellow, here is sixpence for thee.
Come, sit down by me and I will drink with
thee. Here&#8217;s a good health to the king!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart,&#8221; said the cobbler. &#8220;I
will pledge thee that were it only in water.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the cobbler sat down by the king and
was very merry. He sang some of his merry
songs and catches at which the king laughed
heartily, and was very pleasant with the cobbler,
telling him, withal, that his name was
Harry Tudor and that he belonged to the court
and that if the cobbler would come to see him
there, he would make him very welcome because
he was such a merry companion. He
charged him to come and not forget his name,
and to ask anyone about the court for him.
&#8220;For,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;I am well known there.
They will bring you to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the cobbler little dreamed that it was
the king that spoke to him, much less that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the king&#8217;s name was Harry Tudor. Therefore,
with a great deal of confidence, he stood
up, and pulled off his hat and gave the king
many thanks, telling him that he was one of
the most honest fellows he had ever met in all
his life, and that, though he had never been at
court, it would not be long before he would
make a holiday and come to see him. Whereupon
the king, having discharged the reckoning
for what he had had, would have taken
leave, but the cobbler, taking the king by the
hand said, &#8220;By my faith! thou shalt not go
yet; thou shalt first go and see my poor habitation,
for thou art the most honest blade I ever
met, and I love an honest, merry companion
with all my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the cobbler took the king with him, over
the way, where he had a cellar adjoining his
stall; which was handsomely furnished for a
man of his calling. Into the cellar he led
the king.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said he, &#8220;sit thee down, thou art
welcome; but I must desire thee to speak
softly for fear of waking my wife, Joan, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
is in her bed nearby, for, if she should wake,
she would certainly make our ears ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this speech of the cobbler&#8217;s the king
laughed, and told him he would be mindful
to follow his directions.</p>

<p>So the cobbler kindled a fire and fetched
a brown loaf, from which he cut a large slice
of bread. This he set before the fire. Then
he brought forth a Cheshire cheese.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said he, &#8220;wilt thou eat some
cheese? There&#8217;s as much good fellowship in
eating, as in drinking.&#8221; This made the king
admire the freedom of the cobbler. Having
eaten a piece, the cobbler began, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
health to all true hearts and merry companions,&#8221;
at which the king smilingly said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
pledge thee, old friend, I&#8217;ll pledge thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this manner they ate and drank together,
until almost break of day. The cobbler became
very free with the king, pleasing the
king with several of his old stories.</p>

<p>But suddenly, the cobbler&#8217;s old wife, Joan,
began to show signs of waking.</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith,&#8221; said the cobbler, &#8220;you must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
gone now, for my wife, Joan, begins to grumble.
She will wake presently and I would
not, for all the shoes in my shop, that she
should find thee here.&#8221;</p>

<p>So taking the king upstairs he said, &#8220;Farewell,
honest blade, it shall not be long before
I make a holiday and come to see thee at
court.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king replied, &#8220;Thou shalt be kindly
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they parted, the king going on his way
to Whitehall, and the cobbler back to his cellar
where he put all things to rights before
his wife, Joan, appeared. He went to work
again whistling and singing as merry as he
used to do, much satisfied that he had happened
on such a good companion, and
very much delighted at thinking of the merry
time he would have when he went to court.</p>

<p>As soon as the king reached home, he gave
orders to all about the court that if anyone
inquired for him by the name of Harry Tudor,
the person should be brought before him, without
further examination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>To the cobbler every day seemed a month
until he had been at court to see his new acquaintance.
But he was much troubled how
he should get leave of his wife, Joan. He
could not go without her knowledge for he
had resolved to make himself as fine as ever
he could and his wife, Joan, always kept his
holiday clothes. One evening as they sat at supper,
she being in good humour, he began to lay
open his mind to her and tell her the whole
story of the acquaintance, repeating over and
over again that Harry Tudor was the most
honest man he had ever met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Husband,&#8221; said Joan, &#8220;because you have
been so generous as to tell me the truth, I shall
give you leave to take a holiday. You shall
go to court and I will make you as fine as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was agreed that he might go the next
day.</p>

<p>Joan arose the next morning to brush
her husband&#8217;s clothes and to make him
look as snug as could be. She washed and
ironed his lace band, and made his shoes shine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
till he could see his face in them. When this
was done she made her husband arise and
dressed him carefully in his best clothes.</p>

<p>The cobbler being thus equipped in his best
strutted through the streets, like a crow, thinking
himself very fine indeed. In this manner
he came to court, staring at this person and
that, as he walked up and down, and not knowing
anyone to ask for but Harry Tudor. At
last he spied one as he thought in the dress of
a serving man. To him he made his address,
saying, &#8220;Dost thou hear, honest fellow, dost
thou know one Harry Tudor who belongs to
the court?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;follow me; and I will
take you to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he took him presently into the
guard-chamber, telling one of the yeomen of
the guard that here was a man who was inquiring
for Harry Tudor.</p>

<p>The yeoman replied, &#8220;I know him very well,
and if you please to go along with me, I will
bring you to him immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the cobbler followed the yeoman much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
admiring the finery of the rooms through
which he passed and thinking within himself
that the yeoman was not very unlike the person
he inquired after. &#8220;He, whom I look
for,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a plain, merry, honest fellow.
His name is Harry Tudor. I suppose he may
be some fine lord or other about the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, friend,&#8221; replied the yeoman, &#8220;I
do not know him very well. Do but follow
me and I will bring you to him straightway.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went on and soon reached the room
where the king sat surrounded by many of his
nobles. As soon as the yeoman had drawn
aside the curtains he called out saying, &#8220;May
it please your majesty, here is one that inquires
for Harry Tudor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cobbler hearing this and thinking he
had committed no less than treason took to his
heels and ran for his life. But not being acquainted
with the several turnings and rooms
through which he had come, he was soon overtaken
and brought before the king, whom the
cobbler little thought to be the person he was
inquiring for. He therefore, fell on his knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
saying, &#8220;May it please your Grace, I am a
poor cobbler and inquired for one called
Harry Tudor, who is a very honest fellow.
I mended the heel of his shoe not long ago,
for which he paid me nobly. I had him afterwards
to my own cellar, where we were very
merry, till my wife, Joan, began to wake,
which put an end to our merriment, for that
time. But I told him that I surely would
come to court to see him, as soon as I conveniently
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;rise up and be not
afraid! Look well about you. Perhaps you
may find the fellow in this company.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cobbler arose and looked wistfully upon
the king and his nobles, but to no purpose;
for, although he thought he saw something in
the king&#8217;s face which he had seen before, yet,
he could not imagine him to be Harry Tudor,
the heel of whose shoe he had mended, and
who had been so merry with him, both at the
inn and in his own cellar.</p>

<p>He therefore told the king he did not expect
to find Harry Tudor among such fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
folks as he saw there, but the person that he
looked for was a plain, honest, true-hearted
fellow, adding withal, that he was sure if
Harry Tudor did but know that he had come
to court he would make him welcome.</p>

<p>At this speech of the cobbler, the king had
much to do to forbear laughing; but keeping
his countenance as well as he could, he said
to the yeoman of the guard, &#8220;Here, take this
honest cobbler down into the cellar and I will
give orders that Harry Tudor shall come to
him presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>So away went the cobbler ready to leap out
of his skin for joy, not only that he had gotten
off so well in his meeting with the king, but
also that he should soon see his friend, Harry
Tudor, again.</p>

<p>The cobbler had not been long in the cellar
before the king came into him, in the same
clothes he had on when the cobbler mended
his shoe. The cobbler knew him immediately
and ran to him and kissed him, saying, &#8220;Honest
Harry, I have made a holiday on purpose
to come and see you, but I had much to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
to get leave of my wife, Joan, who was loathe
I should lose so much time from my work,
but I was resolved to see you. So I made myself
as fine as I could. But I&#8217;ll tell you,
Harry, when I came to court, I was in a pack
of trouble how to find you out. At last I met
a man who told me he knew you very well,
and that he would bring me to you. But instead
of doing so he brought me before the
king, who has almost frightened me to death.
But in good faith,&#8221; continued the cobbler, &#8220;I
am resolved to be merry with you, since I have
the good fortune to find you at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, so you shall,&#8221; replied the king, &#8220;we
will be as merry as princes.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that they drank together the king&#8217;s
health.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest Harry, I will pledge thee with all
my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now after the cobbler had made merry, he
began to sing some of his old songs and catches.
This pleased the king very much and made
him laugh most heartily. All of a sudden a
group of nobles came into the cellar richly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
dressed. They stood with heads uncovered
bowing before Harry Tudor. This amazed
the cobbler very much but recovering himself
he looked more closely upon Harry Tudor
and presently he knew him to be the king
whom he had seen in the Presence Chamber.</p>

<p>He immediately fell upon his knees, saying,
&#8220;May it please your Majesty, I am an honest
cobbler and meant no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;nor shall receive
any here, I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He commanded the cobbler, therefore, to
rise and be as merry as he was before; and
though he knew him to be the king yet he
should use the same freedom with him as he
did when he mended his shoe. This kind
speech of the king&#8217;s put the cobbler in as good
humour as he was before. He told the king
many of his best stories and he sang more of
his jolly songs, very much to the satisfaction of
the king and his nobles.</p>

<p>Now the king, considering the pleasant humours
of the cobbler, how innocently merry
he was, and free from any design, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
he laboured very hard, and took a great deal
of pains for a small livelihood, was pleased,
out of his princely grace and favour to allot him
a liberal annuity of forty marks a year for
the better support of his jolly humours and the
maintenance of himself and his wife Joan.
The king ordered that he should be admitted
as one of the courtiers.</p>

<p>This was so much beyond his highest expectations
that it pleased him greatly, much
to the satisfaction of the king.</p>

<p>So after some bows and scrapes, he returned
to his wife, Joan, with the joyful news of his
kind reception at court.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE STORY OF MERRYMIND</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frances Browne</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there lived in the north
country a certain poor man and his wife, who
had two corn-fields, three cows, five sheep, and
thirteen children. Twelve of these children
were called by names common in the north
country&mdash;Hardhead, Stiffneck, Tightfingers,
and the like; but when the thirteenth came to
be named, either the poor man and his wife
could remember no other name, or something
in the child&#8217;s look made them think it proper,
for they called him Merrymind, which the
neighbours thought a strange name, and very
much above their station; however, as they
showed no other signs of pride, the neighbours
let that pass. Their thirteen children grew
taller and stronger every year, and they had
hard work to keep them in bread; but when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
the youngest was old enough to look after his
father&#8217;s sheep, there happened the great fair,
to which everybody in the north country went,
because it came only once in seven years. It
was held on midsummer-day, not in any town
or village, but on a green plain, lying between
a broad river and a high hill, where it was
said the fairies used to dance in old and merry
times.</p>

<p>Merchants and dealers of all sorts crowded
to that fair from far and near. There was
nothing known in the north country that could
not be bought or sold in it, and neither old nor
young were willing to go home without a fairing.
The poor man who owned this large
family could afford them little to spend in
such ways; but as the fair happened only once
in seven years, he would not show a poor
spirit. Therefore, calling them about him, he
opened the leathern bag in which his savings
were stored, and gave every one of the thirteen
a silver penny.</p>

<p>The boys and girls had never before owned
so much pocket-money; and, wondering what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
they should buy, they dressed themselves in
their holiday clothes, and set out with their
father and mother to the fair. When they
came near the ground that midsummer morning,
the stalls, heaped up with all manner of
merchandise, from gingerbread upwards, the
tents for fun and feasting, the puppet-shows,
the rope-dancers, and the crowd of neighbours
and strangers, all in their best attire, made
those simple people think their north country
fair the finest sight in the world. The day
wore away in seeing wonders, and in chatting
with old friends. It was surprising how far
silver pennies went in those days; but before
evening twelve of the thirteen had got fairly
rid of their money. One bought a pair of
brass buckles, another a crimson riband, a
third green garters; the father bought a tobacco-pipe,
the mother a horn snuffbox&mdash;in
short, all had provided themselves with fairings
except Merrymind.</p>

<p>The cause of the silver penny remaining in
his pocket was that he had set his heart upon
a fiddle; and fiddles enough there were in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
fair&mdash;small and large, plain and painted: he
looked at and priced most of them, but there
was not one that came within the compass of
a silver penny. His father and mother warned
him to make haste with his purchase, for they
must all go home at sunset because the way
was long.</p>

<p>The sun was getting low and red upon the
hill; the fair was growing thin, for many dealers
had packed up their stalls and departed;
but there was a mossy hollow in the great hillside,
to which the outskirts of the fair had
reached, and Merrymind thought he would see
what might be there. The first thing was a
stall of fiddles, kept by a young merchant from
a far country, who had many customers, his
goods being fine and new; but hard by sat a
little gray-haired man, at whom everybody had
laughed that day, because he had nothing on
his stall but one old dingy fiddle, and all its
strings were broken. Nevertheless, the little
man sat as stately, and cried, &#8220;Fiddles to sell!&#8221;
as if he had the best stall in the fair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buy a fiddle, my young master?&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
as Merrymind came forward. &#8220;You shall
have it cheap: I ask but a silver penny for it;
and if the strings were mended, its like would
not be in the north country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Merrymind thought this a great bargain.
He was a handy boy, and could mend the
strings while watching his father&#8217;s sheep. So
down went the silver penny on the little man&#8217;s
stall, and up went the fiddle under Merrymind&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my young master,&#8221; said the little
man, &#8220;you see that we merchants have a deal
to look after, and if you help me to bundle up
my stall, I will tell you a wonderful piece of
news about that fiddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Merrymind was good-natured and fond of
news, so he helped him to tie up the loose
boards and sticks that composed his stall
with ah old rope, and when they were
hoisted on his back like a fagot, the little
man said:</p>

<p>&#8220;About that fiddle, my young master: it is
certain the strings can never be mended, nor
made new, except by threads from the night-spinners,
which, if you get, it will be a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
pennyworth,&#8221; and up the hill he ran like a
greyhound.</p>

<p>Merrymind thought that was queer news,
but being given to hope the best, he believed
the little man was only jesting, and made haste
to join the rest of the family, who were soon
on their way home. When they got there
everyone showed his bargain, and Merrymind
showed his fiddle; but his brothers and sisters
laughed at him for buying such a thing when
he had never learned to play. His sisters
asked him what music he could bring out of
broken strings; and his father said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast shown little prudence in laying
out thy first penny, from which token I fear
thou wilt never have many to lay out.&#8221;</p>

<p>In short, everybody threw scorn on Merrymind&#8217;s
bargain except his mother. She, good
woman, said if he laid out one penny ill, he
might lay out the next better; and who knew
but his fiddle would be of use some day? To
make her words good, Merrymind fell to repairing
the strings&mdash;he spent all his time, both
night and day, upon them; but, true to the
little man&#8217;s parting words, no mending would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
stand, and no string would hold on that fiddle.
Merrymind tried everything, and wearied
himself to no purpose. At last he thought of
inquiring after people who spun at night; and
this seemed such a good joke to the north
country people that they wanted no other till
the next fair.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Merrymind lost credit at
home and abroad. Everybody believed in his
father&#8217;s prophecy; his brothers and sisters
valued him no more than a herd-boy; the
neighbours thought he must turn out a scape-grace.
Still the boy would not part with his
fiddle. It was his silver pennyworth, and he
had a strong hope of mending the strings for
all that had come and gone; but since nobody
at home cared for him except his mother, and
as she had twelve other children, he resolved
to leave the scorn behind him, and go to seek
his fortune.</p>

<p>The family were not very sorry to hear of
that intention, being in a manner ashamed of
him; besides, they could spare one out of
thirteen. His father gave him a barley cake,
and his mother her blessing. All his brothers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
and sisters wished him well. Most of the
neighbours hoped that no harm would happen
to him; and Merrymind set out one summer
morning with the broken-stringed fiddle
under his arm.</p>

<p>There were no highways then in the north
country&mdash;people took whatever path pleased
them best; so Merrymind went over the fair
ground and up the hill, hoping to meet the
little man, and learn something of the night-spinners.
The hill was covered with heather
to the top, and he went up without meeting
anyone. On the other side it was steep and
rocky, and after a hard scramble down, he
came to a narrow glen all overgrown with wild
furze and brambles. Merrymind had never
met with briars so sharp, but he was not the
boy to turn back readily, and pressed on in
spite of torn clothes and scratched hands, till
he came to the end of the glen, where two
paths met: one of them wound through a
pinewood, he knew not how far, but it seemed
green and pleasant. The other was a rough,
stony way leading to a wide valley surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
by high hills, and overhung by a dull, thick
mist, though it was yet early in the summer
evening.</p>

<p>Merrymind was weary with his long journey,
and stood thinking of what path to
choose, when, by the way of the valley, there
came an old man as tall and large as any
three men of the north country. His white
hair and beard hung like tangled flax about
him! his clothes were made of sackcloth; and
on his back he carried a heavy burden of dust
heaped high in a great pannier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, you lazy vagabond!&#8221; he said,
coming near to Merrymind. &#8220;If you take the
way through the wood I know not what will
happen to you; but if you choose this path
you must help me with my pannier, and I can
tell you it&#8217;s no trifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, father,&#8221; said Merrymind, &#8220;you seem
tired, and I am younger than you, though not
quite so tall; so, if you please, I will choose
this way, and help you along with the pannier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarce had he spoken when the huge man
caught hold of him, firmly bound one side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
the pannier to his shoulders with the same
strong rope that fastened it on his own back,
and never ceased scolding and calling him
names as they marched over the stony ground
together. It was a rough way and a heavy
burden, and Merrymind wished himself a
thousand times out of the old man&#8217;s company,
but there was no getting off; and at length, in
hopes of beguiling the way, and putting him
in better humour, he began to sing an old
rhyme which his mother had taught him. By
this time they had entered the valley, and the
night had fallen very dark and cold. The old
man ceased scolding, and by a feeble glimmer
of the moonlight, which now began to shine,
Merrymind saw that they were close by a deserted
cottage, for its doors stood open to the
night winds. Here the old man paused, and
loosed the rope from his own and Merrymind&#8217;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;For seven times seven years,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;have I carried this pannier, and no one ever
sang while helping me before. Night releases
all men, so I release you. Where will you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
sleep&mdash;by my kitchen-fire, or in that cold cottage?&#8221;</p>

<p>Merrymind thought he had got quite
enough of the old man&#8217;s society, and therefore
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;The cottage, good father, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sound sleep to you, then!&#8221; said the old
man, and he went off with his pannier.</p>

<p>Merrymind stepped into the deserted cottage.
The moon was shining through door
and window, for the mist was gone, and the
night looked clear as day; but in all the valley
he could hear no sound, nor was there any
trace of inhabitants in the cottage. The hearth
looked as if there had not been a fire there for
years. A single article of furniture was not
to be seen; but Merrymind was sore weary,
and, laying himself down in a corner, with his
fiddle close by, he fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>The floor was hard, and his clothes were
thin, but all through his sleep there came a
sweet sound of singing voices and spinning-wheels
and Merrymind thought he must have
been dreaming when he opened his eyes next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
morning on the bare and solitary house. The
beautiful night was gone, and the heavy mist
had come back. There was no blue sky, no
bright sun to be seen. The light was cold and
grey, like that of mid-winter; but Merrymind
ate the half of his barley cake, drank from a
stream hard by, and went out to see the valley.</p>

<p>It was full of inhabitants, and they were all
busy in houses, in fields, in mills, and in forges.
The men hammered and delved; the women
scrubbed and scoured; the very children were
hard at work; but Merrymind could hear
neither talk nor laughter among them. Every
face looked careworn and cheerless, and every
word was something about work or gain.</p>

<p>Merrymind thought this unreasonable, for
everybody there appeared rich. The women
scrubbed in silk, the men delved in scarlet.
Crimson curtains, marble floors, and shelves
of silver tankards were to be seen in every
house; but their owners took neither ease nor
pleasure in them, and everyone laboured as it
were for life.</p>

<p>The birds of that valley did not sing&mdash;they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
were too busy pecking and building. The
cats did not lie by the fire&mdash;they were all on
the watch for mice. The dogs went out after
hares on their own account. The cattle and
sheep grazed as if they were never to get another
mouthful; and the herdsmen were all
splitting wood or making baskets.</p>

<p>In the midst of the valley there stood a
stately castle, but instead of park and gardens,
brew-houses and washing-greens lay round it.
The gates stood open, and Merrymind ventured
in. The courtyard was full of coopers.
They were churning in the banquet hall.
They were making cheese on the dais, and
spinning and weaving in all its principal
chambers. In the highest tower of that busy
castle, at a window from which she could see
the whole valley, there sat a noble lady. Her
dress was rich, but of a dingy drab colour.
Her hair was iron-grey; her look was sour
and gloomy. Round her sat twelve maidens
of the same aspect, spinning on ancient distaffs,
and the lady spun as hard as they, but
all the yarn they made was jet black.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>No one in or out of the castle would reply
to Merrymind&#8217;s salutations, nor answer him
any questions. The rich men pulled out their
purses, saying, &#8220;Come and work for wages!&#8221;
The poor men said, &#8220;We have no time to
talk!&#8221; and a child by a cottage-door said it
must go to work. All day Merrymind wandered
about with his broken-stringed fiddle,
and all day he saw the great old man marching
round and round the valley with his heavy
burden of dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the dreariest valley that ever I beheld!&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;And no place to
mend my fiddle in; but one would not like to
go away without knowing what has come over
the people, or if they have always worked so
hard and heavily.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the night again came on: he
knew it by the clearing mist and the rising
moon. The people began to hurry home in
all directions. Silence came over house and
field; and near the deserted cottage Merrymind
met the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I pray you tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
what sport or pastime have the people of this
valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sport and pastime!&#8221; cried the old man, in
great wrath. &#8220;Where did you hear of the
like? We work by day and sleep by night.
There is no sport in Dame Dreary&#8217;s land!&#8221;
and, with a hearty scolding for his idleness
and levity, he left Merrymind to sleep once
more in the cottage.</p>

<p>That night the boy did not sleep so sound:
though too drowsy to open his eyes, he was
sure there had been singing and spinning near
him all night; and, resolving to find out what
this meant before he left the valley, Merrymind
ate the other half of his barley cake,
drank again from the stream, and went out to
see the country.</p>

<p>The same heavy mist shut out sun and sky;
the same hard work went forward wherever
he turned his eyes; and the great old man with
the dust-pannier strode on his accustomed
round. Merrymind could find no one to answer
a single question; rich and poor wanted
him to work still more earnestly than the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
before; and fearing that some of them might
press him into service, he wandered away to
the furthest end of the valley.</p>

<p>There there was no work, for the land lay
bare and lonely, and was bounded by grey
crags, as high and steep as any castle-wall.
There was no passage or outlet but through a
great iron gate secured with a heavy padlock:
close by it stood a white tent, and in the door
a tall soldier, with one arm, stood smoking a
long pipe. He was the first idle man Merrymind
had seen in the valley, and his face
looked to him like that of a friend; so coming
up with his best bow, the boy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Honourable master soldier, please to tell
me what country is this, and why do the people
work so hard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a stranger in this place, that you
ask such questions?&#8221; answered the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Merrymind, &#8220;I came but the
evening before yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am sorry for you, for here you must
remain. My orders are to let everybody in
and nobody out; and the giant with the dust-pannier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
guards the other entrance night and
day,&#8221; said the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is bad news,&#8221; said Merrymind, &#8220;but
since I am here, please to tell me why were
such laws made, and what is the story of this
valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold my pipe, and I will tell you,&#8221; said
the soldier, &#8220;for nobody else will take the time.
This valley belongs to the lady of yonder
castle, whom, for seven times seven years, men
have called Dame Dreary. She had another
name in her youth&mdash;they called her Lady
Littlecare; and then the valley was the fairest
spot in all the north country. The sun shone
brightest there; the summers lingered longest.
Fairies danced on the hill-tops; singing-birds
sat on all the trees. Strongarm, the last of
the giants, kept the pine-forest, and hewed
yule logs out of it, when he was not sleeping
in the sun. Two fair maidens, clothed in
white, with silver wheels on their shoulders,
came by night and spun golden threads by the
hearth of every cottage. The people wore
homespun, and drank out of horn; but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
had merry times. There were May-games,
harvest-homes, and Christmas cheer among
them. Shepherds piped on the hillsides, reapers
sang in the fields, and laughter came with
the red firelight out of every house in the evening.
All that was changed, nobody knows
how, for the old folks who remembered it are
dead. Some say it was because of a magic
ring which fell from the lady&#8217;s finger; some,
because of a spring in the castle-court which
went dry. However it was, the lady turned
Dame Dreary. Hard work and hard times
overspread the valley. The mist came down;
the fairies departed; the giant Strongarm
grew old, and took up a burden of dust; and
the night-spinners were seen no more in any
man&#8217;s dwelling. They say it will be so till
Dame Dreary lays down her distaff, and
dances; but all the fiddlers of the north country
have tried their merriest tunes to no purpose.
The king is a wise prince and a great
warrior. He has filled two treasure-houses,
and conquered all his enemies; but he cannot
change the order of Dame Dreary&#8217;s land. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
cannot tell you what great rewards he offered
to one who could do it; but when no good
came of his offers, the king feared that similar
fashions might spread among his people,
and therefore made a law that whomsoever
entered should not leave it. His majesty took
me captive in war, and placed me here to keep
the gate, and save his subjects trouble. If I
had not brought my pipe with me, I should
have been working as hard as any of them by
this time, with my one arm. Young master,
if you take my advice you will learn to smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my fiddle were mended it would be better,&#8221;
said Merrymind; and he sat talking with
the soldier till the mist began to clear and the
moon to rise, and then he went home to sleep
in the deserted cottage.</p>

<p>It was late when he came near it, and the
moonlight looked lovely beside the misty day.
Merrymind thought it was a good time for
trying to get out of the valley. There was no
foot abroad, and no appearance of the giant;
but as Merrymind drew near to where the two
paths met, there was he fast asleep beside a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
fire of pinecones, with his pannier at his
head, and a heap of stones close by him. &#8220;Is
that your kitchen-fire?&#8221; thought the boy to
himself, and he tried to steal past; but
Strongarm started up, pursued him with
stones, and called him bad names halfway
back to the cottage.</p>

<p>Merrymind was glad to run the whole way
for fear of him. The door was still open, and
the moon was shining in; but by the lifeless
hearth there sat two fair maidens, all in white,
spinning on silver wheels, and singing together
a blithe and pleasant tune like the larks on
May-morning. Merrymind could have listened
all night, but suddenly he bethought him
that these must be the night-spinners, whose
threads would mend his fiddle; so, stepping
with reverence and good courage, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Honourable ladies, I pray you give a poor
boy a thread to mend his fiddle-strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For seven times seven years,&#8221; said the fair
maidens, &#8220;have we spun by night in this deserted
cottage, and no mortal has seen or
spoken to us. Go and gather sticks through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
all the valley to make a fire for us on this cold
hearth, and each of us will give you a thread
for your pains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Merrymind took his broken fiddle with him,
and went through all the valley gathering
sticks by the moonlight; but so careful were
the people of Dame Dreary&#8217;s land, that scarce
a stick could be found, and the moon was
gone and the misty day had come before he
was able to come back with a small fagot. The
cottage-door was still open; the fair maidens
and their silver wheels were gone; but on the
floor where they sat lay two long threads of
gold.</p>

<p>Merrymind first heaped up his fagot on the
hearth, to be ready against their coming at
night, and next took up the golden threads to
mend his fiddle. Then he learned the truth
of the little man&#8217;s saying at the fair, for no
sooner were the strings fastened with those
golden threads than they became firm. The
old dingy fiddle, too, began to shine and glisten,
and at length it was golden also. This
sight made Merrymind so joyful that, unlearned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
as he was in music, the boy tried to
play. Scarce had his bow touched the strings
when they began to play of themselves the
same blithe and pleasant tune which the night-spinners
sang together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the workers will stop for the sake
of this tune,&#8221; said Merrymind, and he went
out along the valley with his fiddle. The music
filled the air; the busy people heard it;
and never was such a day seen in Dame
Dreary&#8217;s land. The men paused in their delving,
the women stopped their scrubbing; the
little children dropped their work; and everyone
stood still in their places while Merrymind
and his fiddle passed on. When he
came to the castle, the coopers cast down their
tools in the court; the churning and cheese-making
ceased in the banquet hall; the looms
and spinning-wheels stopped in the principal
chambers; and Dame Dreary&#8217;s distaff stood
still in her hand.</p>

<p>Merrymind played through the halls and
up the tower-stairs. As he came near, the dame
cast down her distaff, and danced with all her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
might. All her maidens did the like; and as
they danced she grew young again&mdash;the sourness
passed from her looks, and the greyness
from her hair. They brought her the dress
of white and cherry colour she used to wear
in her youth, and she was no longer Dame
Dreary, but the Lady Littlecare, with golden
hair, and laughing eyes, and cheeks like summer
roses.</p>

<p>Then a sound of merrymaking came up
from the whole valley. The heavy mist rolled
away from the hills; the sun shone out; the
blue sky was seen; a clear spring gushed up
in the castle-court; a white falcon came from
the east with a golden ring, and put it on the
lady&#8217;s finger. After that Strongarm broke the
rope, tossed the pannier of dust from his
shoulder, and lay down to sleep in the sun.
That night the fairies danced on the hill-tops;
and the night-spinners, with their silver
wheels, were seen by every hearth, and no
more in the deserted cottage. Everybody
praised Merrymind and his fiddle; and when
news of his wonderful playing came to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
king&#8217;s ears, he commanded the iron gate to be
taken away; he made the captive soldier a
freeman; and promoted Merrymind to be his
first fiddler, which under that wise monarch
was the highest post in his kingdom.</p>

<p>As soon as Merrymind&#8217;s family and neighbours
heard of the high preferment his fiddle
had gained for him, they thought music must
be a good thing, and man, woman, and child
took to fiddling. It is said that none of them
ever learned to play a single tune except Merrymind&#8217;s
mother, on whom her son bestowed
great presents.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
